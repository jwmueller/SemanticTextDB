==========================================
SemanticTextDB - When NLP meets databases.
==========================================

A database for document-storage/retrieval with automated curation
and structure discovery, so that documents may be efficiently organized 
and queried not only based on human-labeled attributes/metadata, but also using 
a variety of optional automatically-inferred latent features including: 
semantics, topics, sentiment, eloquence, and entities of interest. 

Inference of these properties is done using various statistical models and 
NLP algorithms stored and run inside the database.

==========================================
What makes SemanticTextDB so cool?
==========================================

We support augmented postgreSQL SELECT statments via the semanticSelect() API. This method provides you the power of cutting edge NLP
algorithms, with no additional coding. Its as easy as:

`semanticSelect(table_name, postgreSQL_SELECT_statment, NLP_feature, feature_param)`

For example, we can find President Obama's approval rating given a twitter table as follows:

`statement = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM twitter_text` 

`             WHERE content LIKE '%Barack Obama%'`

`             AND twitter_text.country = 'US'"`

`posCount = semanticSelect('twitter_text', statement, 'positive_only', 0.8)`

`negCount = semanticSelect('twitter_text', statement, 'negative_only', -0.8)`

`approval_rating = posCount / negCount #assumes negCount != 0.`

==========================================
Use Cases: The power of SemanticTextDB
==========================================

1. SELECT documents by topic. (e.g. lawyers can search for laws pertaining to the topic "transportation safety.")

2. SELECT documents with a summary view. A short document summary allows viewing of the document query results in a concise form.

3. Discover population trends with sentiment analysis. (e.g. determining approval of candidates in upcoming elections)

4. Educational purposes - spelling correction and graded of student homework documents added to database.

5. Future NLP use cases. word_counts, word_frequencies, etc. can be selected for each document.

Installation
------------

You will need Python 3.2 and pip installed.

See next two sections for server and client installation.

Server (where postgresql database is running) Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The postgresql server requires:

1. Python 3 installed

2. PL/Python installed. This is installed as follows in postgresql on the server:

`CREATE OR REPLACE LANGUAGE plypython3u;`

You can also just run this (from the client) in python using the psycopg2 library as follows:

`cur = conn.cursor() #where conn is the psycopg2.connect() connection to the database`
`cur.execute("CREATE OR REPLACE LANGUAGE plypthon3u;")`

Other library dependencies:

1. numpy (pip install numpy)

    `$ [sudo] pip install numpy`

2. scipy (pip install scipy)

    `$ [sudo] pip install scipy`

3. pyscopg2 which can be installed with pip as follows:

    `$ [sudo] pip install psycopg2`


Client Installation - clients use the SemanticTextDB library built on psycopg2 python interface driver.
---------------------------------------------------------------

Clients using SemanticTextDB requires:

1. psycopg2

    `$ [sudo] pip install psycopg2`

2. NLTK - download within python terminal. A GUI will pop-up. Click download.

    `import nltk`

    `nltk.download()`

3. textblob (and its dependencies)

    `$ [sudo] pip install -U textblob`

4. sumy (and its dependencies)

    `$ [sudo] pip install sumy`


Using SemanticTextDB
--------------------

Simply clone the repo and refer to SemanticTextDB_Tutorial.py for documentation.

With respect to viewing the tutorial, we STRONGLY recommend using iPython Notebook for viewing the SemanticTextDB_Tutorial.py.
Use SemanticTextDB_Tutorial.ipynb when viewing in ipython notebook. The experience is highly enhanced.
