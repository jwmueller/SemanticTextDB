A database for document-storage/retrieval with automated curation
and structure discovery, so that documents may be efficiently organized 
and queried not only based on human-labeled attributes/metadata, but also using 
a variety of optional automatically-inferred latent features including: 
semantics, topics, sentiment, eloquence, and entities of interest. 

Inference of these properties is done using various statistical models and 
NLP algorithms stored and run inside the database.
