“(a)(1) The Secretary of Defense shall conduct a review of the various systems used to measure the readiness of reserve units of the Armed Forces and shall implement a measurement system for the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces to provide an objective and uniform evaluation of the readiness of all units of the Armed Forces. The measurement system should be designed to produce information adequate to provide comparisons concerning the readiness of all units.

The study should be integrated with an evaluation of the system for measuring unit effectiveness to be implemented in accordance with subsection (a).

“(2) As part of the report under subsection (a)(2), the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives a report on the study carried out under paragraph (1).

The test program should begin at the earliest realistic date.

“(B) In developing training programs for the reserve components, the Secretary shall give increased attention to innovative training technologies, techniques, and schedules that recognize the limitations on time and the geographic dispersion of the reserve components.


“(2) Not later than March 31, 1985, the Secretary shall submit a report to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives describing the study under paragraph (1).
