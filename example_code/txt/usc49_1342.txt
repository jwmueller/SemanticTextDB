The court may award appropriate relief, including a temporary or permanent injunction, punitive damages, and assessment of civil penalties, considering the same factors as prescribed for the Secretary in an administrative case under section 60122.

The action may be brought in the judicial district in which the defendant resides, is found, or does business. The court may punish a failure to obey the order as a contempt of court.

The defendant shall be tried as provided in rule 42(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (18 App. U.S.C.).

(c) Effect on Tort Liability.—This chapter does not affect the tort liability of any person.

In subsection (a)(1), the text of 49 App.:1677(b)(2) and 2006(b)(2) and the words “shall have jurisdiction to determine such actions” in 49 App.:1679b(a)(1) and 2008(a)(1) are omitted as redundant and because of 28:1331 and 1345. The word “civil” is added for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code and because of rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.).

The words “contumacy or” are omitted as surplus. The word “premises” is added for clarity and consistency. The words “or examine” are omitted as being included in “inspect”.
In subsection (b), the words “mandatory or prohibitive” are omitted as surplus. The words “the defendant may demand a jury trial” are substituted for “trial shall be by the court or, upon demand of the accused, by a jury” to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code.
In subsection (c), the words “common law or statutory” are omitted as surplus.
