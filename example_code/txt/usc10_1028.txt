Adjustment of retired pay and retainer pay to reflect changes in Consumer Price Index(a) Prohibition on Recomputation To Reflect Increases in Basic Pay.—Unless otherwise specifically provided by law, the retired pay of a member or former member of an armed force may not be recomputed to reflect any increase in the rates of basic pay for members of the armed forces.

(2) Percentage increase.—Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the Secretary shall increase the retired pay of each member and former member by the percent (adjusted to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent) by which—(A) the price index for the base quarter of that year, exceeds

(B) the base index.


(3) Reduced percentage for certain post-august 1, 1986 members.—If the percent determined under paragraph (2) is greater than 1 percent, the Secretary shall increase the retired pay of each member and former member who first became a member on or after August 1, 1986, and has elected to receive a bonus under section 322 (as in effect before the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008) or section 354 of title 37, by the difference between—(A) the percent determined under paragraph (2); and

(B) 1 percent.


(4) Special rule for paragraph (3).—If in any case in which an increase in retired pay that would otherwise be made under paragraph (3) is not made by reason of law (other than any provision of this section), then (unless otherwise provided by law) when the next increase in retired pay is made under this subsection, the increase under paragraph (3) shall be carried out so as to achieve the same net increase in retired pay under that paragraph that would have been the case if that law had not been enacted.

(5) Regulations.—Any increase in retired pay under this subsection shall be made in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.


(c) First COLA Adjustment for Members With Retired Pay Computed Using Final Basic Pay.—(1) First adjustment with intervening increase in basic pay.—Notwithstanding subsection (b) but subject to subsection (f)(3), if a person described in paragraph (3) becomes entitled to retired pay based on rates of monthly basic pay that became effective after the last day of the calendar quarter of the base index, the retired pay of the member or former member shall be increased on the effective date of the next adjustment of retired pay under subsection (b) only by the percent (adjusted to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent) by which—(A) the price index for the base quarter of that year, exceeds

(B) the price index for the calendar quarter immediately before the calendar quarter in which the rates of monthly basic pay on which the retired pay is based became effective.


(2) First adjustment with no intervening increase in basic pay.—If a person described in paragraph (3) becomes entitled to retired pay on or after the effective date of an adjustment in retired pay under subsection (b) but before the effective date of the next increase in the rates of monthly basic pay, the retired pay of the member or former member shall be increased (subject to subsection (f)(3) as applied to other members whose retired pay is computed on the current rates of basic pay in the most recent adjustment under this section), effective on the date the member becomes entitled to that pay, by the percent (adjusted to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent) by which—(A) the base index, exceeds

(B) the price index for the calendar quarter immediately before the calendar quarter in which the rates of monthly basic pay on which the retired pay is based became effective.


(3) Members covered.—Paragraphs (1) and (2) apply to a member or former member of an armed force who first became a member of a uniformed service before August 1, 1986, and whose retired pay base is determined under section 1406 of this title.


(d) First COLA Adjustment for Members With Retired Pay Computed Using High-Three.—Notwithstanding subsection (b) but subject to subsection (f)(3), the retired pay of a member or former member of an armed force who first became a member of a uniformed service before August 1, 1986, or on or after August 1, 1986, if the member or former member did not elect to receive a bonus under section 322 (as in effect before January 28, 2008) or section 354 of title 37 and whose retired pay base is determined under section 1407 of this title shall be increased on the effective date of the first adjustment of retired pay under subsection (b) after the member or former member becomes entitled to retired pay by the percent (adjusted to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent) equal to the difference between the percent by which—(1) the price index for the base quarter of that year, exceeds

(2) the price index for the calendar quarter immediately before the calendar quarter during which the member became entitled to retired pay.


(e) Pro Rating of Initial Adjustment.—Notwithstanding subsection (b) but subject to subsection (f)(3), the retired pay of a member or former member of an armed force who first became a member of a uniformed service on or after August 1, 1986, and elected to receive a bonus under section 322 (as in effect before January 28, 2008) or section 354 of title 37 shall be increased on the effective date of the first adjustment of retired pay under subsection (b) after the member or former member becomes entitled to retired pay by the percent (adjusted to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent) equal to the difference between—(1) the percent by which—(A) the price index for the base quarter of that year, exceeds

(B) the price index for the calendar quarter immediately before the calendar quarter during which the member became entitled to retired pay; and


(2) one-fourth of 1 percent for each calendar quarter from the quarter described in paragraph (1)(B) to the quarter described in paragraph (1)(A).


If in any case the percent described in paragraph (2) exceeds the percent determined under paragraph (1), such an increase shall not be made.

(f) Prevention of Pay Inversions.—(1) Prevention of retired pay inversions for members with retired pay computed using final basic pay.—The monthly retired pay of a member or a former member of an armed force who first became a member of a uniformed service before September 8, 1980, and who initially became entitled to that pay on or after January 1, 1971, may not be less than the monthly retired pay to which he would be entitled if he had become entitled to retired pay at an earlier date based on the grade in which the member is retired, adjusted to reflect any applicable increases in such pay under this section. In computing the amount of retired pay to which such a member or former member would have been entitled on that earlier date, the computation shall be based on his grade, length of service, and the rate of basic pay applicable to him at that time, except that such computation may not be based on a rate of basic pay for a grade higher than the grade in which the member is retired. This subsection does not authorize any increase in the monthly retired pay to which a member was entitled for any period before October 7, 1975.

(2) Prevention of retired pay inversions for members with retired pay computed using high-three.—Subject to subsections (d) and (e), the monthly retired pay of a member or former member of an armed force who first became a member of a uniformed service on or after September 8, 1980, may not be less, on the date on which the member or former member initially becomes entitled to such pay, than the monthly retired pay to which the member or former member would be entitled on that date if the member or former member had become entitled to retired pay on an earlier date, adjusted to reflect any applicable increases in such pay under this section. However, in the case of a member or former member whose retired pay is computed subject to section 1407(f) of this title, paragraph (1) (rather than the preceding sentence) shall apply in the same manner as if the member or former member first became a member of a uniformed service before September 8, 1980, but only with respect to a calculation as of the date on which the member or former member first became entitled to retired pay.

(3) Prevention of cola inversions.—The percentage of the first adjustment under this section in the retired pay of any person, as determined under subsection (c)(1), (c)(2), (d), or (e), may not exceed the percentage increase in retired pay determined under subsection (b)(2) that is effective on the same date as the effective date of such first adjustment.

Sense of Congress on Equal Treatment of Effective Dates for Future Cost-of-Living Adjustments for Military and Civilian RetireesPub. L. 103–337, div. A, title VI, § 632, Oct. 5, 1994, 108 Stat. 2786, provided that:
“(a) Findings.—Congress makes the following findings:“(1) Congress, in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 [Pub. L. 103–66, see Tables for classification], changed the effective dates for future cost-of-living adjustments for military retired pay and for Federal civilian retirement annuities, which (before that Act) were provided by law to be made effective on December 1 each year.

“(2) The timing, and the percentage of increase, of military and Federal civilian retirees’ cost-of-living adjustments have been linked for decades.

“(3) The effect of the enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 was to abandon the longstanding congressional practice of treating military and Federal civilian retirees identically in matters related to cost-of-living adjustments.


“(b) Sense of Congress.—In light of the findings in subsection (a), it is the sense of Congress that—“(1) as a matter of simple equity and fairness, it is imperative that cost-of-living adjustments in retirement benefits for military and Federal civilian retirees be returned to an identical schedule as soon as possible, but not later than January 1, 1999;

“(2) if after October 1, 1998, there is, by law, a difference between the date on which a cost-of-living adjustment for Federal civilian retirees takes effect and the date on which a cost-of-living adjustment for military retirees takes effect, then the difference in those effective dates should be eliminated by requiring that cost-of-living adjustments for both classes of retirees become effective on the earlier of the two dates; and

“(3) if after October 1, 1998, there is, by law, a difference between the first month for which a cost-of-living adjustment for civilian retirees is payable and the first month for which a cost-of-living adjustment for military retirees is payable, then the difference in the months for which those adjustments are first payable should be eliminated by requiring that the cost-of-living adjustments for both classes of retirees first become payable for the earlier of the two months.”

Any such waiver may be made retroactive, in the case of any such retiree, to the date on which that retiree initially became entitled to retired pay.

“(b) Covered Retirees.—This section applies to any military retiree—“(1) who initially became entitled to retired pay on or after January 1, 1971, and before the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 5, 1994];

“(2) whose retired pay, by reason of the provisions of section 1401a(f) of title 10, United States Code (the so-called ‘Tower amendment’), was initially computed as an amount greater than would have been the case but for that section; and

“(3) who, as of the earlier computation date applicable to that retiree—“(A) in the case of an individual retired in an enlisted grade, had served in the grade in which the retiree retired for a period that was less than the period prescribed by the applicable administrative time-in-grade requirement described in subsection (d); and

“(B) in the case of an individual retired in an officer grade—“(i) was subject to an administrative time-in-grade requirement described in subsection (d) that established a time-in-grade requirement that was longer than the statutory time-in-grade requirement applicable to that member; and

“(ii) had served in the grade in which the retiree retired for a period that was less than the period prescribed by such administrative time-in-grade requirement but not less than the statutory time-in-grade requirement applicable to that member.




“(c) Earlier Computation Date.—For purposes of subsection (b)(3), the earlier computation date applicable to a military retiree is the date that (under such section 1401a(f) as in effect on the date of the member’s retirement) was the ‘earlier date’ that was used as the basis for the computation of the retiree’s retired pay.

“(d) Regulations Subject to Waiver.—A regulation that may be waived under subsection (a) is any regulation (not required by law) that establishes a minimum period of time that a member of the Armed Forces must have served in a grade on active duty in order to be eligible to retire in that grade.

“(e) Scope of Waiver Authority.—The Secretary concerned may exercise the authority provided in subsection (a) in the case of an individual military retiree or for any group of military retirees.

“(f) Military Retiree Defined.—For purposes of this section, the term ‘military retiree’ means a member or former member of the Armed Forces who is entitled to retired pay.

“(g) Secretary Concerned.—For purposes of this section, the term ‘Secretary concerned’ has the meaning given such term in section 101 of title 10, United States Code.”

“(2) The amendment made by paragraph (1) shall not take effect unless legislation is enacted which provides for the adjustment of annuities paid under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, on a once-a-year basis. In the event such legislation is enacted, such amendment shall become effective with respect to adjustments in the retired pay and retainer pay of members and former members of the uniformed services at the same time that the legislation providing for such a once-a-year adjustment of annuities paid under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, becomes effective.

“(3) If legislation described in paragraph (2) is enacted to provide for the adjustment of annuities paid under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, on a once-a-year basis, the President shall exercise the authority vested in him under section 292 of the Central Intelligence Agency [Retirement] Act of 1964 for Certain Employees ([former] 50 U.S.C. 403 note) to provide for cost-of-living adjustments in the annuities paid under such Act on an identical basis.

“(4) If at the time the first adjustment in retired and retainer pay is made under section 1401a(b) of title 10, United States Code, as amended by paragraph (1) of this subsection, the period upon which the most recent adjustment in such retired and retainer pay was computed is not identical to the period upon which the most recent adjustment in annuities under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, was computed, then the percentage increase to be made under such section 1401a(b) at the time of the first such adjustment shall be computed in the same manner as the percentage increase made at the same time in annuities under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, is computed, but shall be based on the period beginning on the last day of the period upon which the most recent adjustment in such retired and retainer pay was computed and ending on the last day of the period upon which the adjustment being made at the same time in annuities under such subchapter III is computed. The President shall by Executive order provide for a similar computation of the adjustment in annuities paid under the Central Intelligence Agency [Retirement] Act of 1964 for Certain Employees ([former] 50 U.S.C. 403 note) which is made at the same time as the increase in retired and retainer pay to which the preceeding [preceding] sentence is applicable.


“(c) For the purposes of this section, the term ‘uniformed services’ means—“(1) the Armed Forces; and

“(2) the commissioned corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and of the Public Health Service.”
