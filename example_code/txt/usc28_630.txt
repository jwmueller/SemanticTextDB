§ 1917. District courts; fee on filing notice of or petition for appeal
Upon the filing of any separate or joint notice of appeal or application for appeal or upon the receipt of any order allowing, or notice of the allowance of, an appeal or of a writ of certiorari $5 shall be paid to the clerk of the district court, by the appellant or petitioner.
(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 955.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 552 (Feb. 11, 1925, ch. 204, § 5, 43 Stat. 857; Jan. 31, 1928, ch. 14, § 1, 45 Stat. 54; Sept. 27, 1944, ch. 414, § 3, 58 Stat. 744).
Words “to the clerk of the district court” were added to clarify the intent of Congress, as shown by the title of the 1944 act containing this section, and by the text of such Act in its entirety.
Words “as an additional fee in said suit or action, or proceeding in bankruptcy” were omitted. The entire text of the basic 1944 act shows that Congress intended it to apply to all actions, suits and proceedings, including bankruptcy proceedings, and nowhere else in such act is any reference made to bankruptcy proceedings.
Changes were made in phraseology.
