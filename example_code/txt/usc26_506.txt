(4) Extraordinary dividends and taxable stock dividendsFor purposes only of subpart B (relating to trusts which distribute current income only), there shall be excluded those items of gross income constituting extraordinary dividends or taxable stock dividends which the fiduciary, acting in good faith, does not pay or credit to any beneficiary by reason of his determination that such dividends are allocable to corpus under the terms of the governing instrument and applicable local law.


(5) Tax-exempt interestThere shall be included any tax-exempt interest to which section 103 applies, reduced by any amounts which would be deductible in respect of disbursements allocable to such interest but for the provisions of section 265 (relating to disallowance of certain deductions).

(B) any amount so treated shall be treated as paid or credited to the beneficiary on the last day of such taxable year, and

(C) for purposes of subtitle F, the amount so treated—(i) shall not be treated as a payment of estimated tax made by the trust, but

(B) any United States person not described in subparagraph (A) who is related to such grantor or beneficiary,

(2) Definitions and special rulesFor purposes of this subsection—(A) CashThe term “cash” includes foreign currencies and cash equivalents.
