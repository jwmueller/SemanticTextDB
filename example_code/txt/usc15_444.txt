Codification
Section comprises subsec. (a) of section 20 of act Sept. 19, 1922, as amended by act Feb. 26, 1925. Subsec. (b) of section 20 is classified to section 160 of this title.
In the first sentence, the words “(except as provided by the Act entitled ‘An Act creating a United States Court for China and prescribing the jurisdiction thereof,’ approved June 30, 1906, as amended)” have been omitted because that Act (formerly classified to sections 191 to 197, 199, 200, and 202 of Title 22, Foreign Relations and Intercourse) was repealed by act June 25, 1948, ch. 646, § 39, 62 Stat. 992, eff. Sept. 1, 1948.
The provision in the second sentence that suits against the China Trade Act corporation might also be brought in the United States Court for China was omitted as that court is no longer in operation.
