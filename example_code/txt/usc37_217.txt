The words “on active duty (other than for training)” are substituted for the words “on the active . . . list” to conform to longstanding administrative construction, and because there is no “active list” in the case of many of the uniformed services named, but only for certain regular component of those services, e.g., the “Regular Army” and the “Regular Air Force”. The words “a retired list of that service” are substituted for the words “retired list”, since there is more than one retired list for many of the services named. (See sections 1376, 3966, and 8966 of title 10, for example.) The words “members of the Reserve components of the respective services entitled to Federal pay either on the active or any retired list of said services” are omitted as covered by clause (1), since members of the reserve components are members of the uniformed services concerned. The word “transferred” is omitted as surplusage.
