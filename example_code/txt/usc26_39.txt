“It was the intent of the Congress in providing an investment credit under section 38 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [formerly I.R.C. 1954] and it is the intent of the Congress in repealing the reduction in basis required by section 48(g) of such Code to provide an incentive for modernization and growth of private industry (including that portion thereof which is regulated). Accordingly, Congress does not intend that any agency or instrumentality of the United States having jurisdiction with respect to a taxpayer shall, without the consent of the taxpayer, use—“(1) in the case of public utility property (as defined in section 46(c)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, more than a proportionate part (determined with reference to the average useful life of the property with respect to which the credit was allowed) of the credit against tax allowed for any taxable year by section 38 of such Code, or

“(2) in the case of any other property, any credit against tax allowed by section 38 of such Code,


to reduce such taxpayer’s Federal income taxes for the purpose of establishing the cost of service of the taxpayer or to accomplish a similar result by any other method.”
