Historical and Revision NotesThis section grants powers to the Commandant concerning, in general, operations within the Service and the internal functioning of the Service. Many of the powers are contained in existing law, but some are enlarged, and some additional powers are added as explained following.
Subsection (a) is derived from title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 53, and title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 471 (R.S. 1536). The authority to order vessels to cruise along the coasts should be in the operational head of the Service, and not in the President. This section is changed to cover adequately the necessary present day cruising and patrolling.
Subsection (b) is derived from R.S. 4242 and title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§ 29, 93, 94, 95, 97, 98a (R.S. 4245, 4249; May 4, 1882, ch. 117, §§ 2, 3, 22 Stat. 56; Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601; Aug. 6, 1947, ch. 502, 61 Stat. 786; June 6, 1940, ch. 257, § 4, 54 Stat. 247), and specifically grants to the Commandant authority in regard to the establishment, discontinuance, and change of Coast Guard shore establishments other than Coast Guard districts. This power must exist inherently in order for the Service to function efficiently.
Subsection (c) is derived from title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§ 54, 97, 112 (May 4, 1882, ch. 117, § 3, 22 Stat. 56; May 30, 1908, ch. 231, 35 Stat. 553; Apr. 21, 1910, ch. 182, § 2, 36 Stat. 326), and specifically grants to the Commandant authority in regard to the assignment of vessels, vehicles, aids to navigation, and other equipment. This power is inherent to the proper functioning of any Service.
Subsection (d) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 91 (June 18, 1878, ch. 265, § 7, 20 Stat. 164; June 10, 1921, ch. 18, § 304, 42 Stat. 24; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, § 9, 44 Stat. 817). Said section has been divided. The part dealing with investigation of plans and inventions is covered in this subsection in broader terms, and the other parts are covered in general terms in section 632 of this title.
Subsection (e) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 111 (June 18, 1878, ch. 265, § 9, 20 Stat. 164). This section has been rewritten to broaden the authority to include any investigation or study that may be of assistance to the Coast Guard, the limitation as to investigation of shipwrecks having been eliminated.
Subsection (f) is new and is intended to give legislative recognition to the importance of disseminating information by the Coast Guard for the promotion of safety at sea, life-saving techniques, and other Coast Guard activities.
Subsection (g) is new and provides for the training of Coast Guard personnel at other than schools or institutions of the other armed forces. Such training is essential and has been carried on under the authority of appropriation acts for many years.
Subsection (h) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§ 69, 108, 109, (R.S. 2748; June 20, 1874, ch. 344, § 9, 18 Stat. 127; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, § 3, 20 Stat. 163), and is intended to complement the authority granted to the Secretary in sec. 92(d) of this title granting similar authority to the Commandant as to smaller craft.
Subsection (i) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., §§ 108, 109, and on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 752 (June 20, 1874, ch. 344, § 9, 18 Stat. 127; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, § 3, 20 Stat. 163; Mar. 4, 1913, ch. 168, 37 Stat. 10183, and grants power to the Commandant to acquire and dispose of various equipment and supplies. The authority with respect to the acceptance of such equipment as a gift is new.
Subsection (j) is new and grants power to the Commandant to operate and maintain shore establishments; previously such authority has been inferred from statutes providing for the establishment of shore stations; again such authority is inherent to the functioning of any Service, and this section will provide no greater authority than has been exercised in the past.
Subsection (k) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 31b (June 6, 1941, ch. 177, 55 Stat. 247 [which was originally repealed by act June 30, 1949, ch. 288, title VI, § 602(a)(28), 63 Stat. 399, renumbered Sept. 5, 1950, ch. 849, § 6(a), (b), 64 Stat. 583]). The primary authority is granted to the Commandant as well as to the Secretary inasmuch as such exchange seems to be an operational matter and the items which may be exchanged have been enlarged by the addition of aids to navigation, appliances, equipment, and supplies.
Inasmuch as the act cited above applies to the Navy as well as the Coast Guard it is not scheduled for repeal but is being amended by section 13 of this act to eliminate reference to the Coast Guard.
Subsection (l) is new and is deemed desirable in order to give legislative authority for existing yards, and for the procurement of needed equipment and material in case such is not normally or economically obtainable from private contractors.
Subsection (m) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§ 110, 192 (June 20, 1874, ch. 344, § 6, 18 Stat. 127; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, § 10, 20 Stat. 165; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, § 9, 44 Stat. 817). The power to accept volunteer services is enlarged to include all services offered in time of emergency, to save life or protect property, and the restrictive provisions relating to lifeboat stations only have been eliminated.
Subsection (n) is new and grants authority to the Commandant to lease real property under the control of the Coast Guard, when not immediately needed in Coast Guard operations. Such authority will be advantageous to the Government, on the basis of past experience.
Subsection (o) is new and is supplementary to subsection (n) of this section. It grants further authority to the Commandant permitting him to grant minor interests in land which is under control of the Coast Guard. This will avoid the necessity of special acts of Congress in each of such instances.
Subsection (p) is new and is necessary to give proper authority for the maintenance of networks of wires and cables, in some cases over or along private property or public highways. These networks are in existence at the present time and are essential for the Service to carry out its functions.
Subsection (q) is new and is necessary in order to provide clear authority for the maintenance of radio stations which are essential to Coast Guard functions.
Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.
