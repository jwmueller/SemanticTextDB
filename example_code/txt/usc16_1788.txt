Recreational Opportunities at Federally-Managed Manmade Lakes and ReservoirsPub. L. 104–333, div. I, title X, § 1021(a), Nov. 12, 1996, 110 Stat. 4210, as amended by Pub. L. 106–176, title I, § 123(a), Mar. 10, 2000, 114 Stat. 29, provided that: “The Congress finds that the Federal Government, under the authority of the Reclamation Act [probably means act June 17, 1902, ch. 1093, 32 Stat. 388, see Short Title note under section 371 of Title 43, Public Lands] and other statutes, has developed man-made lakes and reservoirs that have become a powerful magnet for diverse recreational activities and that such activities contribute to the well-being of families and individuals and the economic viability of local communities. The Congress further finds that in order to further the purposes of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the President should appoint an advisory commission to review the current and anticipated demand for recreational opportunities at federally managed man-made lakes and reservoirs through creative partnerships involving Federal, State, and local governments and the private sector and to develop alternatives for enhanced recreational use of such facilities.”
