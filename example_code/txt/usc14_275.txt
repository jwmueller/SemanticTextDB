(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 545; Pub. L. 86–70, § 11, June 25, 1959, 73 Stat. 143; Pub. L. 97–295, § 2(18), Oct. 12, 1982, 96 Stat. 1302.)

Historical and Revision Notes
1949 ActSubsection (a) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 48 (June 22, 1936, ch. 705, § 4, 49 Stat. 1821; July 11, 1941, ch. 290, § 7, 55 Stat. 585).
Subsection (b) is derived from the last 6 lines of title 48, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 1460 (July 31, 1939, ch. 399, 53 Stat. 1143). An additional provision is added waiving the requirement of a performance bond inasmuch as Coast Guard officers appointed as United States commissioners or marshals are not custodians of funds, and in any case their oath as a commissioned officer appears to be sufficient to insure faithful performance of duty.
Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

1982 ActThis amends 14:634(b) to reflect the effect of 28:631(c) and sections 401(a) and 402(a) of the Federal Magistrates Act (Pub. L. 90–578, Oct. 17, 1968, 82 Stat. 1118).

Amendments1982—Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 97–295 struck out “United States Commissioners or” after “appointed as” and last sentence which provided that any commissioned officer appointed as United States Commissioner in Alaska shall not be required to execute a bond for the faithful performance of his official duties as such Commissioner.
1959—Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 86–70 substituted “in Alaska” for “in and for the territory of Alaska” in two places.
