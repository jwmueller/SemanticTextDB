5726(c)5 App.: 73b–4c.July 21, 1966, Pub. L. 89–516, § 2 “Sec. 25”, 80 Stat. 324.


The amendment of subsection (a) of 5 U.S.C. 5726 reflects the addition of a new subsection (c).
Subsection (b) of 5 U.S.C. 5726 was derived from subsection (e) of section 1 of the Administrative Expenses Act of 1946, as amended (74 Stat. 796). In the codification of subsection (e), the words “7,000 pounds net weight” were substituted for “the maximum weight limitation provided by subsection (a)”. During the pendency of the codification bill, section 1(a)(2) of Public Law 89–516, amended subsection (a) of section 1 of the Administrative Expenses Act of 1946 to increase the maximum weight limitation from 7,000 to 11,000 pounds. Thus, the amendment of subsection (b) is necessary to reflect the current weight limitation applicable.
In subsection (c), the word “employee” is substituted for “civilian officer or employee” to conform to the definitions in 5 U.S.C. 5721(2) and 2105. The words “including a new appointee and a student trainee to the extent authorized by section 5723 of this title” are substituted for “including any new appointee in accordance with section 7(b) of this Act, as amended” for clarity and to reflect the codification of section 7(b) in 5 U.S.C. 5723. The words “continental United States” are coextensive with and substituted for “continental United States, excluding Alaska” on authority of the definition of “continental United States” in 5 U.S.C. 5721(3). The words “head of the agency concerned” are substituted for “head of the Executive Department or agency concerned” to conform to the definition in 5 U.S.C. 5721(1). In the penultimate sentence, the words “sections 5723(a) and 5724(a) of this title” are substituted for “section 1 or 7(b) of this Act” to reflect the codification of sections 1 and 7(b) in 5 U.S.C. 5723(a) and 5724(a); and the word “officer” is omitted as included in “employee”. In the last sentence, the words “under this subsection” are inserted for clarity.
Subsection (b) of section 25 of the Administrative Expenses Act of 1946 (added by section 2 of Public Law 89–516) is omitted as executed.

Amendments1996—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 104–201, § 1723(b)(3), substituted “as authorized under regulations prescribed under section 5738 of this title” for “as the President may by regulation authorize”.
Subsecs. (b), (c). Pub. L. 104–201, § 1723(b)(1), substituted “Under regulations prescribed under section 5738 of this title” for “Under such regulations as the President may prescribe”.
