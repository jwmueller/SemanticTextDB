Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 181 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 100, 36 Stat. 1121; Mar. 4, 1915, ch. 159, 38 Stat. 1187; Feb. 14, 1923, ch. 78, 42 Stat. 1246).
Other provisions of said section 181 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in section 1865 of this title.
Provisions relating to the place of institution or trial of prosecutions and civil actions and transfer thereof were omitted. Such provisions, as to civil cases, are covered by section 1391 et seq. of this title, and as to criminal cases, are rendered unnecessary because of inherent power of the court and Rules 18–20 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure relating to venue.
The provision respecting court accommodations at Lima was omitted as covered by section 142 of this title.
Changes were made in arrangement and phraseology.

Amendments2002—Subsec. (b)(2). Pub. L. 107–273, which directed amendment of par. (2) by inserting “St. Clairsville,” after “Columbus,”, was executed by making the insertion after “Columbus”, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
1954—Subsec. (a)(1). Act Feb. 10, 1954, provided for holding court at Akron.
