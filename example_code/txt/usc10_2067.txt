Electric Lighting and Refrigeration Equipment Demonstration ProgramsPub. L. 102–484, div. A, title III, § 384(b)–(d), Oct. 23, 1992, 106 Stat. 2393, provided that:
“(b) Electric Lighting Demonstration Program.—(1) The Secretary of Defense shall conduct a demonstration program for using energy efficient electric lighting equipment.

“(2) The Secretary shall designate 50 facilities owned or leased by the Department of Defense for participation in the demonstration program under this subsection.

“(3) The head of each facility designated pursuant to paragraph (2) and the Director of the Defense Logistics Agency shall jointly audit the electric lighting equipment at the facility in order—“(A) to identify any potential improvements that would increase the energy efficiency of electric lighting at that facility; and

“(B) to determine the costs of, and the savings that would result from, such improvements.


“(4) Except as provided in subsection (d)(4), on the basis of the results of the audit the head of the facility shall promptly convert to the use of electric lighting equipment at the facility that is more energy efficient than the existing electric lighting equipment to the extent that the conversion is cost effective.

“(5) Energy efficient electric lighting equipment used under the demonstration program may include compact fluorescent lamps, energy efficient electric ballasts and fixtures, and other energy efficient electric lighting equipment.


“(c) Refrigeration Equipment Demonstration Program.—(1) The Secretary of Defense shall conduct a demonstration program for using energy efficient refrigeration equipment.

“(2) The Secretary shall designate 50 facilities owned or operated by the Department of Defense for participation in the demonstration program under this subsection.

“(3) The head of each facility designated pursuant to paragraph (2) and the Director of the Defense Logistics Agency shall jointly audit the refrigeration equipment at the facility in order—“(A) to identify any potential improvements that would increase the energy efficiency of the refrigeration equipment at that facility; and

“(B) to determine the costs of, and the savings that would result from, such improvements.


“(4) Except as provided in subsection (d)(4), on the basis of the results of the audit the head of the facility shall promptly convert to the use of refrigeration equipment at the facility that is more energy efficient than the existing refrigeration equipment to the extent that the conversion is cost effective.


“(d) General Provisions for Demonstration Programs.—(1) The Secretary of Defense shall make the designations under subsections (b)(2) and (c)(2) not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 23, 1992].

“(2) The Secretary of Defense may designate a facility described in subsections (b)(2) and (c)(2) for participation in the demonstration program under subsection (b) and the demonstration program under subsection (c).

“(3) The audits required by subsections (b)(3) and (c)(3) shall be completed not later than January 1, 1994.

“(4) The head of a facility may not carry out a conversion described in subsection (b)(4) or (c)(4) if the conversion prevents the head of the facility from carrying out other improvements relating to energy efficiency that are more cost effective than that conversion.”
