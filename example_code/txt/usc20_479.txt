(b) Allotment; graduates basisFrom the amounts appropriated to carry out this part for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall allot to each part B institution a sum which bears the same ratio to one-fourth that amount as the number of graduates for such school year at such institution bears to the total number of graduates for such school year at all part B institutions.


(c) Allotment; graduate and professional student basisFrom the amounts appropriated to carry out this part for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall allot to each part B institution a sum which bears the same ratio to one-fourth of that amount as the percentage of graduates per institution, who are admitted to and in attendance at, within 5 years of graduation with a baccalaureate degree, a graduate or professional school in a degree program in disciplines in which Blacks are underrepresented, bears to the percentage of such graduates per institution for all part B institutions.


(d) Minimum allotment(1) Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (c), and subject to subsection (h), if the amount of an award under this section for a part B institution, based on the data provided by the part B institution and the formula under subsections (a) through (c), would be—(A) an amount that is greater than $250,000 but less than $500,000, the Secretary shall award the part B institution an allotment in the amount of $500,000; and

(e) ReallotmentThe amount of any part B institution’s allotment under subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section for any fiscal year which the Secretary determines will not be required for such institution for the period such allotment is available shall be available for reallotment from time to time on such date during such period as the Secretary may determine to other part B institutions in proportion to the original allotment to such other institutions under this section for such fiscal year.


(f) Special merger rule(1) The Secretary shall permit any eligible institution for a grant under part B in any fiscal year prior to the fiscal year 1986 to apply for a grant under this part if the eligible institution has merged with another institution of higher education which is not so eligible or has merged with an eligible institution.
