“Where—“(1) one or more persons were entitled (without the application of section 202(j)(1) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 402(j)(1)]) to monthly benefits under section 202 of such Act for the month before the month in which this Act is enacted [September 1960] on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of an individual; and

“(2) any person is entitled to benefits under subsection (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) of section 202 of the Social Security Act for any subsequent month on the basis of such individual’s wages and self-employment income and such person would not be entitled to such benefits but for the enactment of this section; and

“(3) the total of the benefits to which all persons are entitled under section 202 of the Social Security Act on the basis of such individual’s wages and self-employment income for such subsequent month is reduced by reason of the application of section 203(a) of such Act [42 U.S.C. 403(a)],


then the amount of the benefit to which each person referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection is entitled for such subsequent month shall not, after the application of such section 203(a), be less than the amount it would have been (determined without regard to section 301 [42 U.S.C. 501]) if no person referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection was entitled to a benefit referred to in such paragraph for such subsequent month on the basis of such wages and self-employment income of such individual.”
