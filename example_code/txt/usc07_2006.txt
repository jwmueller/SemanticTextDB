Any civil action authorized to be brought under this chapter shall be referred to the Attorney General for appropriate action: Provided, That nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring the Secretary to refer to the Attorney General minor violations of this chapter whenever the Secretary believes that the administration and enforcement of the program would be adequately served by suitable written notice or warning to any person committing such violation.


(b) PenaltiesAny end product manufacturer or other person who willfully violates any provision of any order issued by the Secretary under this chapter, or who willfully fails or refuses to remit any assessment or fee duly required thereunder, shall be liable to a penalty of not more than $1,000 for each such offense which shall accrue to the United States and may be recovered in a civil suit brought by the United States.
