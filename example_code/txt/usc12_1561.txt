§ 3803. Alternative mortgage authority(a) General authority; compliance by banks, credit unions and all other housing creditors with applicable regulationsIn order to prevent discrimination against State-chartered depository institutions, and other nonfederally chartered housing creditors, with respect to making, purchasing, and enforcing alternative mortgage transactions, housing creditors may make, purchase, and enforce alternative mortgage transactions, except that this section shall apply—(1) with respect to banks, only to transactions made on or before the designated transfer date, as determined under section 1062 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 [12 U.S.C. 5582], in accordance with regulations governing alternative mortgage transactions as issued by the Comptroller of the Currency for national banks, to the extent that such regulations are authorized by rulemaking authority granted to the Comptroller of the Currency with regard to national banks under laws other than this section;

(2) with respect to credit unions, only to transactions made on or before the designated transfer date, as determined under section 1062 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, in accordance with regulations governing alternative mortgage transactions as issued by the National Credit Union Administration Board for Federal credit unions, to the extent that such regulations are authorized by rulemaking authority granted to the National Credit Union Administration with regard to Federal credit unions under laws other than this section;

(3) with respect to all other housing creditors, including without limitation, savings and loan associations, mutual savings banks, and savings banks, only to transactions made on or before the designated transfer date, as determined under section 1062 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, in accordance with regulations governing alternative mortgage transactions as issued by the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision for federally chartered savings and loan associations, to the extent that such regulations are authorized by rulemaking authority granted to the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision with regard to federally chartered savings and loan associations under laws other than this section; and

(b) Transactions deemed in compliance with applicable regulationsFor the purpose of determining the applicability of this section, an alternative mortgage transaction shall be deemed to be made in accordance with the applicable regulation notwithstanding the housing creditor’s failure to comply with the regulation, if—(1) the transaction is in substantial compliance with the regulation; and
