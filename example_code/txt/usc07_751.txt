§ 948. Lending power(a) Loans for prescribed purposes; requisite conditionsThe Governor of the telephone bank shall make loans on behalf of the telephone bank, to the extent that there are qualifying applications therefor, subject only to limitations as to amounts authorized for loans and advances as may be imposed by law enacted by the Congress of the United States for loans to be made in any one year, and in conformance with policies approved by the Telephone Bank Board, to corporations and public bodies which have received a loan or loan commitment pursuant to section 922 of this title, or which have been certified by the Secretary to be eligible for such a loan or loan commitment, (1) for the same purposes and under the same limitations for which loans may be made under section 922 of this title, (2) for the acquisition, purchase, and installation of telephone lines, systems, and facilities (other than buildings used primarily for administrative purposes, vehicles not used primarily in construction, and customer premise equipment) related to the furnishing, improvement, or extension of rural telecommunications service, and (3) for the purchase of class B stock required to be purchased under section 946(d) of this title but not for the purchase of class C stock, subject, as to the purposes set forth in (2) hereof, to the following provisos: That in the case of any such loan for the acquisition of telephone lines, facilities, or systems, the acquisition shall be approved by the Secretary, the location and character thereof shall be such as to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, or financial stability of the telephone system of the borrower, and in respect of exchange facilities for local services, the size of each acquisition shall not be greater than the borrower’s existing system at the time it receives its first loan from the telephone bank, taking into account the number of subscribers served, miles of line, and plant investment. Loans and advances made under this section shall not be included in the totals of the budget of the United States Government and shall be exempt from any general limitation imposed by statute on expenditures and net lending (budget outlays) of the United States.


(b) Terms and conditions of loans; restrictions on loansLoans under this section shall be on such terms and conditions as the Governor of the telephone bank shall determine, subject, however, to the following restrictions:(1) Amortization periodAll loans made under this section shall be fully amortized over a period not to exceed fifty years.


(2) Preference in loans; election of loans for telephone system with certain subscriber density per mileFunds to be loaned under this chapter to any borrower shall be loaned under this section in preference to section 922 of this title if the borrower is eligible for such a loan and funds are available therefor. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of law, all loans made pursuant to this chapter for facilities for telephone systems with an average subscriber density of three or fewer per mile shall be made under section 922 of this title; but this provision shall not preclude the making of such loans from the telephone bank at the election of the borrower.


(3) Interest rate(A) Loans under this section shall bear interest at the “cost of money rate”. The cost of money rate is defined as the average cost of moneys to the telephone bank as determined by the Governor, but not less than 5 per centum per annum.

(B) On and after December 22, 1987, advances made on or after December 22, 1987, under loan commitments made on or after October 1, 1987, shall bear interest at the rate determined under subparagraph (C), but in no event at a rate that is less than 5 percent per annum.

(C) The rate determined under this subparagraph shall be—(i) for the period beginning on the date the advance is made and ending at the close of the fiscal year in which the advance is made, the average yield (on the date of the advance) on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having a final maturity comparable to the final maturity of the advance; and

(ii) after the fiscal year in which the advance is made, the cost of money rate for such fiscal year, as determined under subparagraph (D).


(D) Within 30 days after the end of each fiscal year, the Governor shall determine to the nearest 0.01 percent the cost of money rate for the fiscal year, by calculating the sum of the results of the following calculations:(i) The aggregate of all amounts received by the telephone bank during the fiscal year from the issuance of class A stock, multiplied by the rate of return payable by the telephone bank during the fiscal year, as specified in section 946(c) of this title, to holders of class A stock, which product is divided by the aggregate of the amounts advanced by the telephone bank during the fiscal year.

(ii) The aggregate of all amounts received by the telephone bank during the fiscal year from the issuance of class B stock, multiplied by the rate at which dividends are payable by the telephone bank during the fiscal year, as specified in section 946(d) of this title, to holders of class B stock, which product is divided by the aggregate of the amounts advanced by the telephone bank during the fiscal year. For purposes of the calculation under this subparagraph, such rate shall be zero.

(iii) The aggregate of all amounts received by the telephone bank during the fiscal year from the issuance of class C stock, multiplied by the rate at which dividends are payable by the telephone bank during the fiscal year, under section 946(e) of this title, to holders of class C stock, which product is divided by the aggregate of the amounts advanced by the telephone bank during the fiscal year.

(iv)(I) The sum of the results of the calculations described in subclause (II).

(II) The amounts received by the telephone bank during the fiscal year from each issue of telephone debentures and other obligations of the telephone bank, multiplied, respectively, by the rates at which interest is payable during the fiscal year by the telephone bank to holders of each issue, each of which products is divided, respectively, by the aggregate of the amounts advanced by the telephone bank during the fiscal year.


(v)(I) The amount by which the aggregate of the amounts advanced by the telephone bank during the fiscal year exceeds the aggregate of the amounts received by the telephone bank from the issuance of class A stock, class B stock, class C stock, and telephone debentures and other obligations of the telephone bank during the fiscal year, multiplied by the historic cost of money rate as of the close of the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year, which product is divided by the aggregate of the amounts advanced by the telephone bank during the fiscal year.

(II) For purposes of this clause, the term “historic cost of money rate”, with respect to the close of a preceding fiscal year, means the sum of the results of the following calculations: The amounts advanced by the telephone bank in each fiscal year during the period beginning with fiscal year 1974 and ending with the preceding fiscal year, multiplied, respectively, by the cost of money rate for the fiscal year (as set forth in the table in subparagraph (E)) for fiscal years 1974 through 1987, and as determined by the Governor under this subparagraph for fiscal years after fiscal year 1987), each of which products is divided, respectively, by the aggregate of the amounts advanced by the telephone bank during the period.



(E) For purposes of subparagraph (D)(II), the cost of money rate for the fiscal years in which each advance was made shall be as set forth in the following table:

In a State in which there is no such agency or regulatory body legally authorized to issue such certificates to the applicant, no loan shall be made under this section unless the Governor of the telephone bank shall determine (and set forth his reasons therefor in writing) that no duplication of lines, facilities, or systems, providing reasonably adequate services will result therefrom.
