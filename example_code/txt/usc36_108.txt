The words “Secretary of Veterans Affairs” are substituted for “Secretary of the Army” because of section 6 of the National Cemeteries Act of 1973 (Public Law 93–43, 38 U.S.C. 2404 note), which transferred jurisdiction over and responsibility for the national cemeteries (with certain exceptions) from the Secretary of the Army to the Administrator of Veterans’ Affairs. The words “as may be determined by the Commission” are omitted as unnecessary.
