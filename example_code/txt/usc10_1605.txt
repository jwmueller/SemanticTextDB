(B) before a solicitation for proposals for the contract was issued the Secretary notified the congressional defense committees of the Secretary’s intention to issue such a solicitation;

(C) the Secretary has notified those committees of the proposed contract and provided a detailed description of the terms of the proposed contract and a justification for entering into the proposed contract rather than providing for the lease, charter, or services involved through purchase of the vessel, aircraft, or combat vehicle to be used under the contract, and a period of 30 days of continuous session of Congress has expired following the date on which notice was received by such committees; and

(D) the Secretary has certified to those committees—(i) that entering into the proposed contract as a means of obtaining the vessel, aircraft, or combat vehicle is the most cost-effective means of obtaining such vessel, aircraft, or combat vehicle; and

(ii) that the Secretary has determined that the lease complies with all applicable laws, Office of Management and Budget circulars, and Department of Defense regulations.



(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(C), the continuity of a session of Congress is broken only by an adjournment of the Congress sine die, and the days on which either House is not in session because of an adjournment of more than three days to a day certain are excluded in a computation of such 30-day period.

(3) Upon receipt of a notice under paragraph (1)(C), a committee identified in paragraph (1)(B) may request the Inspector General of the Department of Defense or the Comptroller General of the United States to conduct a review of the proposed contract to determine whether or not such contract meets the requirements of this section.

(4) If a review is requested under paragraph (3), the Inspector General of the Department of Defense or the Comptroller General of the United States, as the case may be, shall submit to the Secretary and the congressional defense committees a report on such review before the expiration of the period specified in paragraph (1)(C).

(5) In the case of a contract described in subsection (a)(1)(B), the commander of the special operations command may make a contract without regard to this subsection if—(A) funds are available and obligated for the full cost of the contract (including termination costs) on or before the date the contract is awarded;

(2) Any such analysis shall be reviewed and evaluated by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of the Treasury within 30 days after the date on which the request and analysis are submitted to Congress. The Director and Secretary shall conduct such review and evaluation on the basis of the guidelines issued pursuant to subsection (f) and shall report to Congress in writing on the results of their review and evaluation at the earliest practicable date, but in no event more than 45 days after the date on which the request and analysis are submitted to the Congress.

(B) funds appropriated to the Department of Defense for operation and maintenance may not be obligated or expended for the lease or charter.


(2) In this subsection, the terms “capital lease” and “lease-purchase” have the meanings given those terms in Appendix B to Office of Management and Budget Circular A–11, as in effect on January 6, 2006.


(g) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of the Treasury shall jointly issue guidelines for determining under what circumstances the Department of Defense may use lease or charter arrangements for aircraft, naval vessels, and combat vehicles rather than directly procuring such aircraft, vessels, and combat vehicles.

(h) The Secretary of a military department may make a contract for the lease of a vessel or for the provision of a service through use by a contractor of a vessel, the term of which is for a period of greater than two years, but less than five years, only if—(1) the Secretary has notified the congressional defense committees of the proposed contract and included in such notification—(A) a detailed description of the terms of the proposed contract and a justification for entering into the proposed contract rather than obtaining the capability provided for by the lease, charter, or services involved through purchase of the vessel;
