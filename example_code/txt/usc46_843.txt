6030746 App.:122.R.S. § 4220.


The words “with a registry endorsement or a coastwise endorsement” are substituted for “if such vessel be licensed, registered, or enrolled” for consistency with chapter 121 of the revised title. The words “belonging to any citizen of the United States” are omitted as unnecessary because, under chapter 121 as amended by this bill, ownership by a citizen of the United States is a requirement for documentation. The words “and light money” are added for clarity and consistency. See 19 C.F.R. § 4.21 (2003).
