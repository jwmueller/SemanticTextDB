“SEC. 5. TUITION REFUNDS OR CREDITS.“(a) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of the Congress that all institutions offering postsecondary education should provide a full refund to any member or Reserve of an Armed Force on active duty service in connection with Operation Desert Shield or Operation Desert Storm for that portion of a period of instruction such individual was unable to complete, or for which such individual did not receive academic credit, because he or she was called up for such service. For purposes of this section, a full refund includes a refund of required tuition and fees, or a credit in a comparable amount against future tuition and fees.

“(b) Encouragement and Report.—The Secretary of Education shall encourage institutions to provide such refunds or credits, and shall report to the appropriate committees of Congress on the actions taken in accordance with this subsection as well as information he receives regarding any institutions that are not providing such refunds or credits.
