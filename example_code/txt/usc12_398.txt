§ 635o. Congressional statement of purpose
The purpose of this subchapter is—(1) to expand employment and economic growth in the United States by expanding United States exports to the markets of the developing world;

(2) to stimulate the economic development of countries in the developing world by improving their access to credit for the importation of United States products and services for developmental purposes;

(3) to neutralize the predatory financing engaged in by many nations whose exports compete with United States exports, and thereby restore export competition to a market basis; and

(4) to encourage foreign governments to enter into effective and comprehensive agreements with the United States to end the use of tied aid credits for exports, and to limit and govern the use of export credit subsidies generally.
