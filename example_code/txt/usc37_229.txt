A member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps, on active duty who is absent from his regular duties for a continuous period of more than one day because of disease that is directly caused by and immediately follows his intemperate use of alcoholic liquor or habit-forming drugs is not entitled to pay for the period of that absence. However, a member whose pay is forfeited for more than one month is entitled to $5 for personal expenses for each full month that his pay is forfeited.
