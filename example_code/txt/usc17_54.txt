Historical and Revision Notes
house report no. 94–1476Section 507, which is substantially identical with section 115 of the present law [section 115 of former title 17], establishes a three-year statute of limitations for both criminal proceedings and civil actions. The language of this section, which was adopted by the act of September 7, 1957 (71 Stat. 633) [Pub. L. 85–313, § 1, Sept. 7, 1957, 71 Stat. 633], represents a reconciliation of views, and has therefore been left unaltered.

Amendments1998—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 105–304 substituted “Except as expressly provided otherwise in this title, no” for “No”.
1997—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 105–147 substituted “5” for “three”.
