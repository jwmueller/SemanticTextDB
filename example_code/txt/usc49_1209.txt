In this section, before clause (1), the words “In this subchapter” are substituted for “As used in this chapter” and “Whenever in this chapter reference is made to . . . such reference shall mean” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code and to eliminate unnecessary words.
Clause (1) restates the definition of “air carrier airport” that was contained in section 11(1) of the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 as in effect both on February 18, 1980, and immediately before September 3, 1982.

In subclause (ii), the words “existing airport hazard . . . the creation of a new airport hazard” are added for clarity and consistency in this chapter.
In clause (3)(D), the words “any . . . work involved to” are omitted as surplus. The word “Secretary” is substituted for “Department of Transportation” because of 49:102(b). The words “Administrator of the” are added because of 49:106(b).
In clause (4), the word “near” is substituted for “in the vicinity of” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “obstructs or otherwise is hazardous to the landing or taking off” are substituted for “obstructs the airspace required for the flight of aircraft in landing or taking off . . . or is otherwise hazardous to such landing or taking off” for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.
In clause (6), the words “for a fiscal year . . . for that fiscal year” are omitted as surplus. The words “authorized for grants” are substituted for “made available for obligation” for clarity and consistency. The word “law” is substituted for “Act of Congress” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. The words “or limited” are omitted as surplus.
In clause (8), before subclause (A), the words “the initial as well as continuing” and “nature” are omitted as surplus. In subclause (C), the words “needed to decide which aeronautical needs should be met” are substituted for “as may be necessary to determine the short-, intermediate-, and long-range aeronautical demands required to be met” for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words. The word “particular” is eliminated as unnecessary. In subclause (D), the word “prescribed” is substituted for “the establishment . . . of” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code.
In clause (9), the words “scheduled and nonscheduled” are omitted as surplus. The word “cargo” is substituted for “property (including mail)” for consistency in the revised title.
In clause (10), before subclause (A), the words “passenger boardings” are substituted for “passengers enplaned” for clarity. In subclause (A), the words “domestic, territorial, and international”, “in the States”, “scheduled and nonscheduled”, and “intrastate, interstate, and foreign” are omitted as surplus. In subclause (B), the words “who continue on an aircraft in” are substituted for “on board” for clarity. (See Cong. Rec., pp. S15296, 15297, Oct. 28, 1987, daily ed.). The words “that stops” are substituted for “which transit” for clarity. The word “located” is omitted as surplus.
In clause (12), the words “included in one project grant application” are substituted for “submitted together”, and the words “or all projects to be undertaken” are substituted for “including the combined submission of all projects”, for clarity and consistency in this chapter.
In clause (15)(A), the words “or any agency of a State, a municipality . . . other” are omitted as surplus.
In clause (19)(A), the words “either individually or jointly with one or more other public agencies” are omitted as surplus.
In clause (20), the words “the Commonwealth of” and “the Government of” are omitted as surplus.
