(IV) require the Administration to review each Program Participant’s performance regarding attainment of business activity targets during periodic reviews of such Participant’s business plan; and

(V) authorize the Administration to take appropriate remedial measures with respect to a Program Participant that has failed to attain a required business activity target for the purpose of reducing such Participant’s dependence on contracts awarded pursuant to section 637(a) of this title; such remedial actions may include, but are not limited to assisting the Program Participant to expand the dollar volume of its competitive business activity or limiting the dollar volume of contracts awarded to the Program Participant pursuant to section 637(a) of this title; except for actions that would constitute a termination, remedial measures taken pursuant to this subclause shall not be reviewable pursuant to section 637(a)(9) of this title.



(J)(i) The Administration shall conduct an evaluation of a Program Participant’s eligibility for continued participation in the Program whenever it receives specific and credible information alleging that such Program Participant no longer meets the requirements for Program eligibility.

Congressional Findings and Declaration of Purposes of Pub. L. 100–656Pub. L. 100–656, title I, § 101, Nov. 15, 1988, 102 Stat. 3855, provided that:
“(a) Findings.—The Congress finds that—“(1) the Capital Ownership Development Program administered by the Small Business Administration and the award of contracts pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act [15 U.S.C. 637(a)] remain a primary tool for improving opportunities for small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in the Federal procurement process and bringing such concerns into the nation’s economic mainstream;

“(2) although some progress has resulted from the Program, it has generally failed to meet its objectives, which remain as valid now as when the Program was initiated;

“(3) too few concerns that have exited the Program have been prepared to compete successfully in the open marketplace on competitive procurements, and many concerns have developed an unhealthy dependency on sole-source contracts by the time they are required to leave the Program;

“(4) the application and certification process for admitting new participants to the Program is inordinately lengthy and burdensome;

“(5) the Administration has often not efficiently and equitably administered and managed the Program in a manner that provided clear lines of responsibility for implementing and monitoring many of the administrative duties under the Program;

“(6) the Administration and some program participants have given insufficient attention and support to the business development goals of the Program and instead have focused almost entirely on the size of contract awards or the number of firms certified to participate in the Program;

“(7) many Federal procuring agencies have failed to identify and offer the necessary amount of contract support in order to allow for diversification and growth of disadvantaged businesses participating in the Program;

“(8) contract support as well as business development expenses have been misused both by the Administration and Program participants and have not been equitably distributed pursuant to objective criteria;

“(9) the widespread perception of undue political influence in the operation and administration of the Program has significantly contributed to the Program’s poor image and has deterred utilization of the Program by socially and economically disadvantaged concerns and by Federal procuring agencies; and

“(10) it is imperative that increased competition and other substantial reforms be accomplished in the Program in order to promote the Congressionally mandated business development objectives and purposes.


“(b) Purposes.—The purposes of this Act [see Short Title of 1988 Amendment note set out under section 631 of this title] therefore are to—“(1) affirm that the Capital Ownership Development Program and the section 8(a) [15 U.S.C. 637(a)] authority shall be used exclusively for business development purposes to help small businesses owned and controlled by the socially and economically disadvantaged to compete on an equal basis in the mainstream of the American economy;

“(2) affirm that the measure of success of the Capital Ownership Development Program, and the section 8(a) authority, shall be the number of competitive firms that exit the Program without being unreasonably reliant on section 8(a) contracts and that are able to compete on an equal basis in the mainstream of the American economy;

“(3) ensure that program benefits accrue to individuals who are both socially and economically disadvantaged;

“(4) increase the number of small businesses owned and controlled by such individuals from which the United States may purchase products and services (including construction work); and

“(5) ensure integrity, competence, and efficiency in the administration of business development services and the Federal contracting opportunities made available to eligible small businesses.”

“(a) Training Requirements for Business Opportunity Specialists.—(1) In each Small Business Administration field office responsible for assisting one or more Program Participants there shall be a position designated as a Business Opportunity Specialist. To the maximum extent practicable the Administration shall assure that an adequate number of Business Opportunity Specialists are assigned to each district office to carry out the responsibilities of sections 7(j) and 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(j), 637(a)) and to assist Program Participants.

“(2) The Administration shall take such actions as may be appropriate to ensure that any person employed as a Business Opportunity Specialist receives adequate periodic training to assure such employee is capable of assisting Program Participants to fully utilize the Program and to meet the requirements of the Small Business Act [15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.], as amended by this Act.


“(b) Pilot Program.—(1) Within 180 days after the effective date of this subsection [Nov. 15, 1988] the Administrator shall designate three regions of the Administration to conduct a pilot program pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. The designated regions shall contain approximately 30 per centum of the total number of Program Participants as of the time of designation.

“(2) A Business Opportunity Specialist employed in a Region designated pursuant to paragraph (1), in addition to other assigned duties and responsibilities, shall—“(A) conduct contract negotiations on behalf of the Administration for contracts awarded pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)) when performance will be rendered by one or more firms in such Specialist’s assigned portfolio;

“(B) facilitate and otherwise assist such firms in negotiating for the receipt of contracts to be let pursuant to such section.


“(3) The Administration shall take such actions as may be appropriate to train and qualify such Specialists to perform the negotiations required pursuant to paragraph (2).

“(4) To the extent practicable, the Administrator shall ensure that the performance appraisal system applicable to a Business Opportunity Specialist employed in a region designated pursuant to paragraph (1) affords substantial recognition to how well such Specialist’s assigned portfolio of concerns participating in the program established by section 7(j)(10) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(j)(10)) are achieving competitiveness and furthering the business development purposes of the program.

“(5) The Administration shall establish personnel positions for Business Opportunity Specialists employed in the regions designated pursuant to paragraph (1) that are classified at a grade level of the General Schedule that are sufficient, in the opinion of the Administrator, to attract and retain highly qualified personnel.


“(c) Report and Pilot Program Termination.—(1) Within 120 days after the termination of the pilot program conducted pursuant to subsection (b), the Administration shall issue a report to the Committees on Small Business of the Senate and of the House of Representatives [Committee on Small Business of Senate now Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship of Senate] on the effectiveness of the pilot. Such report shall contain such recommendations for administrative or legislative change as may be appropriate.

“(2) The pilot program conducted pursuant to subsection (b) shall be terminated three years after the date on which the Committees on Small Business of the Senate and of the House of Representatives [Committee on Small Business of Senate now Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship of Senate] receive written notification from the Administrator that the pilot is in full operation in each of the three designated pilot regions.”
