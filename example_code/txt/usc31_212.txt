332731:526.R.S. § 3644.


The words “Secretary of the Treasury” are substituted for “Treasurer” because of the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title. The words “may issue a check or other draft” are substituted for “shall be subject to the draft of” for consistency in the revised title. The words “public money” are substituted for “moneys” because section 10 of the Act of August 6, 1846 (ch. 90, 9 Stat. 61), from which section 3644 of the Revised Statutes is derived, used the term “public money”. The words “obligation of the United States Government” are substituted for “on the public account”, and the words “may designate a depositary to issue a check or draft on public money held by the depositary to pay an obligation of the Government” are substituted for “is authorized to draw upon any of the depositaries” for clarity and consistency. The words “at such times and in such forms . . . shall be” are omitted as surplus. The words “United States Postal Service” and “Postmaster General” are omitted because of 39:410. The words “report to the Secretary on public money paid and received by the depositary” are substituted for “so drawn upon shall make returns to the Treasury Department” for clarity and consistency.
