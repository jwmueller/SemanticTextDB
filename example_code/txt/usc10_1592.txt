Therefore, in order to provide financial support for such businesses, as well as meeting other normal demands on its resources, the annual direct lending authority of the Export-Import Bank of the United States should be increased by at least 150 percent from the fiscal year 1990 level over the five-year period beginning October 1, 1990.

“(3) Transition to nondefense production required to be considered.—In determining whether to provide financial support for an export transaction, the Export-Import Bank of the United States shall take into account, to the extent feasible and in accordance with applicable standards and procedures established by the bank in consultation with the Committee, the fact that the product or service is produced or provided by any business or group of workers which—“(A) was substantially and seriously affected by defense budget reductions; and

“(B) is in transition from defense to nondefense production.



“(b) SBA Use of Authority for Export Financing Assistance.—In determining whether to provide financial or other assistance under the Small Business Act [15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.], title VIII of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 [Pub.

“(2) is in transition from defense to nondefense production.


“(c) Coordination and Integration of Activities and Assistance with Other Agencies.—In providing additional financial assistance pursuant to any increase in loan authority under this division—“(1) Federal agencies concerned with international trade shall participate in the process of coordination conducted by the Committee pursuant to section 4004(c)(1); and

“(2) such Federal agencies shall attempt, to the maximum extent practicable, to coordinate and integrate the activities and assistance of the agencies in support of exports, including financial assistance in the form of direct loans, loan guarantees, and insurance, general trade promotion, marketing assistance, and marketing and commercial information, in a manner consistent with the purposes of this division (and the amendments made by this division to other provisions of law).


“(d) Reporting.—The annual reports made by the Export-Import Bank of the United States and the Administrator of the Small Business Administration and the annual economic stabilization and adjustment report under section 4004(c)(3) of this division shall include a description of the extent to which the bank and the Administrator are—“(1) providing financing described in subsections (a)(2) and (b), respectively, to businesses or groups of workers which were substantially and seriously affected by defense budget reductions; and
