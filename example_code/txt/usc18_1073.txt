§ 3194. Transportation of fugitive by receiving agent
Any agent appointed as provided in section 3182 of this title who receives the fugitive into his custody is empowered to transport him to the State or Territory from which he has fled.
(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 825.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 663 (R.S. § 5279).
Last sentence of said section 663, relating to rescue of such fugitive, was omitted as covered by section 752 of this title, the punishment provision of which is based on later statutes. (See reviser’s note under that section.)
Minor changes were made in phraseology.
