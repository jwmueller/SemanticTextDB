References in TextThis subchapter, referred to in subsecs. (d)(1), (2), (4)(B), (5), (e)(1), (2), and (f)(2), was in the original “this title”, meaning title II of Pub.

Section 5390(n)(14) of this title, referred to in subsec. (d)(1)(C), probably means section 5390(n)(9), because section 5390(n) of this title does not contain a par. (14) and section 5390(n)(9) of this title relates to orderly liquidation plans.
