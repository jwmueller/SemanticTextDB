Such districts may include such areas of surveyed and unsurveyed lands as he determines may be conveniently administered as a unit, even if such areas are neither contiguous nor adjacent.

(b) The Secretary, after the establishment of a district, is authorized to lease the grazing privileges therein in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter.11 See References in Text note below.

References in TextThis subchapter, referred to in subsec. (b), was in the original “this title” and has been translated as if the reference was to “this Act” to reflect the probable intent of Congress inasmuch as the act of Mar. 4, 1927, was not divided into titles.
