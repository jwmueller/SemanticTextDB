(B) the use of the metric system of measurement for services and materials required for incorporation in individual projects to construct Federal buildings.


The construction metrication ombudsman shall be independent of the contracting officer for construction contracts.

(3) The ombudsman shall respond to each complaint in writing within 60 days and make a recommendation to the head of the executive agency for an appropriate resolution thereto.

(B) whether the availability of hard-metric products and services from United States firms is sufficient to ensure full and open competition; and

(C) the total installed price to the Federal Government.


(4) After the head of the agency has rendered a decision regarding a recommendation of the ombudsman, the ombudsman shall be responsible for communicating the decision to all appropriate policy, design, planning, procurement, and notifying personnel in the agency. The ombudsman shall conduct appropriate monitoring as required to ensure the decision is implemented, and may submit further recommendations, as needed. The head of the agency’s decision on the ombudsman’s recommendations, and any supporting documentation, shall be provided to affected parties and made available to the public in a timely manner.
