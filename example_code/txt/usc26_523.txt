(b) Reversionary interest taking effect at death of minor lineal descendant beneficiaryIn the case of any beneficiary who—(1) is a lineal descendant of the grantor, and

(2) holds all of the present interests in any portion of a trust,


the grantor shall not be treated under subsection (a) as the owner of such portion solely by reason of a reversionary interest in such portion which takes effect upon the death of such beneficiary before such beneficiary attains age 21.

(c) Special rule for determining value of reversionary interestFor purposes of subsection (a), the value of the grantor’s reversionary interest shall be determined by assuming the maximum exercise of discretion in favor of the grantor.

However, income for any period shall not be included in the income of the grantor by reason of the preceding sentence if such income would not be so includible in the absence of such postponement.
