§ 4086. Temporary safe-keeping of federal offenders by marshals
United States marshals shall provide for the safe-keeping of any person arrested, or held under authority of any enactment of Congress pending commitment to an institution.
(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 851.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 691, 692, (R.S. §§ 5537, 5538).
Said section 691 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is superseded by sections 753b and 753c of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which are incorporated in sections 4002, 4003 and 4042 of this title.
This section is rewritten to retain the intent of section 692 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which was to insure a safekeeping of United States prisoners until their commitment or confinement in Federal penal institutions. The language conforms with that of said sections 692 and 753b.
Minor changes were made in phraseology.
