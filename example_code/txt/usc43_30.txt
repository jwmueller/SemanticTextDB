§ 31c. Geologic mapping program(a) Establishment(1) In generalThere is established a national cooperative geologic mapping program between the United States Geological Survey and the State geological surveys, acting through the Association.


(2) Design, development, and administrationThe cooperative geologic mapping program shall be—(A) designed and administered to achieve the objectives set forth in subsection (c) of this section;

(B) developed in consultation with the advisory committee; and

(C) administered through the Survey.



(b) Responsibilities of the Survey(1) Lead agencyThe Survey shall be the lead Federal agency responsible for planning, developing national priorities and standards for, coordinating, and managing the geologic mapping program. In carrying out this paragraph, the Secretary, acting through the Director, shall—(A) develop a 5-year strategic plan for the geologic mapping program in accordance with section 31e of this title, which plan shall be submitted to the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate not later than 1 year after March 30, 2009;

(B) appoint, with the advice and consultation of the Association, the advisory committee not later than 1 year after March 30, 2009, in accordance with section 31d of this title; and

(C) submit biennially a report to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate and to the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives identifying—(i) how the Survey and the Association are coordinating the development and implementation of the geologic mapping program;

(ii) how the Survey and the Association establish goals, mapping priorities, and target dates for implementation of the geologic mapping program; and

(iii) how long-term staffing plans for the various components of the geologic mapping program affect successful implementation of the geologic mapping program.



(2) Responsibilities of the SecretaryIn addition to paragraph (1), the Secretary, acting through the Director, shall be responsible for developing, as soon as practicable—(A) in cooperation with the Association, other Federal and State agencies, public and private sector organizations and academia, the geologic-map data base; and

(B) maps and mapping techniques which achieve the objectives specified in subsection (c) of this section.



(c) Program objectivesThe objectives of the geologic mapping program shall include—(1) determining the Nation’s geologic framework through systematic development of geologic maps at scales appropriate to the geologic setting and the perceived applications, such maps to be contributed to the national geologic map data base;

(2) development of a complementary national geochronologic and paleontologic data base that provides value-added descriptive and interpretative information to the geologic-map data base;

(3) application of cost-effective mapping techniques that assemble, produce, translate and disseminate geologic-map information and that render such information of greater application and benefit to the public; and

(4) development of public awareness of the role and application of geologic-map information to the resolution of national issues of land use management.


(d) Program components(1) Federal component(A) In generalThe geologic mapping program shall include a Federal geologic mapping component, the objective of which shall be to determine the geologic framework of areas determined to be vital to the economic, social, environmental, or scientific welfare of the United States.


(B) Mapping prioritiesFor the Federal component, mapping priorities—(i) shall be described in the 5-year plan under section 31e of this title; and

(ii) shall be based on—(I) national requirements for geologic map information in areas of multiple-issue need or areas of compelling single-issue need;

(II) national requirements for geologic map information in areas where mapping is required to solve critical earth science problems; and

(IV) geophysical investigations that assist in delineating and mapping the physical characteristics and 3-dimensional distribution of geologic materials and geologic structures; and

(V) geochemical investigations and analytical operations that characterize the composition of geologic map units.


(iii) Use of resultsThe results of investigations under clause (ii) shall be contributed to national databases.




(2) State component(A) In generalThe geologic mapping program shall include a State geologic mapping component, the objective of which shall be to establish the geologic framework of areas determined to be vital to the economic, social, environmental, or scientific welfare of individual States.


(B) Mapping prioritiesFor the State component, mapping priorities—(i) shall be determined by State panels representing a broad range of users of geologic maps; and

(ii) shall be based on—(I) State requirements for geologic map information in areas of multiple-issue need or areas of compelling single-issue need; and
