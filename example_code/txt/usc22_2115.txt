“SEC. 3133. MINIMUM SECURITY STANDARD FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND FORMULA QUANTITIES OF STRATEGIC SPECIAL NUCLEAR MATERIAL.“(a) Policy.—It is the policy of the United States to work with the international community to take all possible steps to ensure that all nuclear weapons around the world are secure and accounted for and that all formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material are eliminated, removed, or secure and accounted for to a level sufficient to defeat the threats posed by terrorists and criminals.

“(b) International Nuclear Security Standard.—It is the sense of Congress that, in furtherance of the policy described in subsection (a), and consistent with the requirement for ‘appropriate effective’ physical protection contained in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004), as well as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, the President, in consultation with relevant Federal departments and agencies, should seek the broadest possible international agreement on a global standard for nuclear security that—“(1) ensures that nuclear weapons and formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material are secure and accounted for to a sufficient level to defeat the threats posed by terrorists and criminals;

“(2) takes into account the limitations of equipment and human performance; and

“(3) includes steps to provide confidence that the needed measures have in fact been implemented.


“(c) International Efforts.—It is the sense of Congress that, in furtherance of the policy described in subsection (a), the President, in consultation with relevant Federal departments and agencies, should—“(1) work with other countries and the International Atomic Energy Agency to assist as appropriate, and if necessary work to convince, the governments of any and all countries in possession of nuclear weapons or formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material to ensure that security is upgraded to meet the standard described in subsection (b) as rapidly as possible and in a manner that—“(A) accounts for the nature of the terrorist and criminal threat in each such country; and

“(B) ensures that any measures to which the United States and any such country agree are sustained after United States and other international assistance ends;


“(2) ensure that United States financial and technical assistance is available, as appropriate, to countries for which the provision of such assistance would accelerate the implementation of, or improve the effectiveness of, such security upgrades; and

“(3) work with the governments of other countries to ensure that effective nuclear security rules, accompanied by effective regulation and enforcement, are put in place to govern all nuclear weapons and formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material around the world.
