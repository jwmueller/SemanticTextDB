In subsection (b)(6)(A), the words “residents, or sons or daughters of residents, of an area or installation” are substituted for “a resident of the area or installation” in 46 App. U.S.C. 1295b(b)(1)(B) and “sons or daughters of residents of any area or installation” in 46 App. U.S.C. 1295b(b)(3)(A)(ii) to resolve an inconsistency in the source law and to conform to the probable intent of Congress. Although 46 App. U.S.C. 1295b(b)(1)(B) provides that a nominee must be a resident, 46 App. U.S.C. 1295b(b)(3)(A)(ii) allocates positions only for sons or daughters of residents.

Amendments2011—Subsec. (b)(3). Pub. L. 111–383, § 3503(1), inserted “the Northern Mariana Islands,” after “Guam,”.
Subsec. (b)(5), (6). Pub. L. 111–383, § 3503(2), redesignated par. (6) as (5) and struck out former par. (5) which read as follows: “The Governor of the Northern Mariana Islands may nominate residents of the Northern Mariana Islands.”
