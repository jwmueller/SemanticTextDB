Historical and Revision Notes
1948 ActBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 338 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 215, 35 Stat. 1130).
The obsolete argot of the underworld was deleted as suggested by Hon. Emerich B. Freed, United States district judge, in a paper read before the 1944 Judicial Conference for the sixth circuit in which he said:
A brief reference to § 1341, which proposes to reenact the present section covering the use of the mails to defraud. This section is almost a page in length, is involved, and contains a great deal of superfluous language, including such terms as “sawdust swindle, green articles, green coin, green goods and green cigars.” This section could be greatly simplified, and now-meaningless language eliminated.
The other surplusage was likewise eliminated and the section simplified without change of meaning.
A reference to causing to be placed any letter, etc. in any post office, or station thereof, etc. was omitted as unnecessary because of definition of “principal” in section 2 of this title.

1949 ActThis section [section 34] corrects a typographical error in section 1341 of title 18, U.S.C.
