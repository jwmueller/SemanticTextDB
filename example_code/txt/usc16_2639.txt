“SEC. 607. LAND PURCHASE.“(a) Finding.—The Congress finds that certain lands owned by Plum Creek in the vicinity of the offered lands (but which are not included in the land exchange under this Act, or are deleted under section 605(c)) are highly desirable for addition to the National Forest System, and that Plum Creek has indicated its willingness to sell certain such lands to the United States. It is the intention of Congress that such lands be acquired by the United States, subject to the availability of funds, by purchase at fair market value consistent with the land acquisition procedures of the Secretary, and with the consent of Plum Creek, in order to preserve their outstanding scenic and natural values for the benefit of future generations.

“(b) Purchase Consultation.—In furtherance of subsection (a), the Secretary is authorized and directed to consult with Plum Creek to determine the precise lands Plum Creek is willing to sell.

“(c) Other Agreements.—Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit the Secretary from entering into additional agreements or contracts with Plum Creek to purchase, exchange or otherwise acquire lands from Plum Creek in Washington or any other state under the laws, rules and regulations generally applicable to Federal land acquisitions.
