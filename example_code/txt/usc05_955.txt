“Sec. 202. It is the policy of the Government—“(1) that the amount required to be contributed to certain public retirement systems by employees and officers of the Government who are also required to pay employment taxes relating to benefits under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] for service performed after December 31, 1983, be modified until the date on which such employees and officers are covered by a new Government retirement system (the design, structure, and provisions of which have not been determined on the date of enactment of this Act [Nov. 29, 1983]) or January 1, 1987, whichever is earlier;

“(2) that the Treasury be required to pay into such retirement systems the remainder of the amount such employees and officers would have contributed during such period but for the temporary modification;

“(3) that the employing agencies make contributions to the retirement systems with respect to such service in amounts required by law in effect before January 1, 1984, without reduction in such amounts;

“(4) that such employees and officers accrue credit for service for the purposes of the public retirement systems in effect on the date of enactment of this Act [Nov. 29, 1983] until a new Government retirement system covering such employees and officers is established;

“(5) that, where appropriate, deposits to the credit of such a retirement system be required with respect to service performed by an employee or officer of the Government during the period described in clause (1), and, where appropriate, annuities be offset by the amount of certain social security benefits attributable to such service; and

“(6) that such employees and officers who are first employed in civilian service by the Government or first take office in civilian service in the Government on or after January 1, 1984, become subject to such new Government retirement system as may be established for employees and officers of the Government on or after January 1, 1984, and before January 1, 1987, with credit for service performed after December 31, 1983, by such employees and officers transferred to such new Government retirement system.
