“Section 254“(a) In determining any income tax imposed by the Government of Palau, the Government of Palau shall have authority to impose tax upon income derived by a resident of Palau from sources without Palau in the same manner and to the same extent as the Government of Palau imposes tax upon income derived from within its jurisdiction. If the Government of Palau exercises such authority as provided in this subsection, any individual resident of Palau who is subject to tax by the Government of the United States on income which is also taxed by the Government of Palau shall be relieved of liability to the Government of the United States for the tax which, but for this subsection, would otherwise be imposed by the Government of the United States on such income. For purposes of this Section, the term ‘resident of Palau’ shall be deemed to include any person who was physically present in Palau for a period of 183 or more days during any taxable year. The relief from liability referred to in this subsection means only:“(1) relief in the form of the foreign tax credit (or deduction in lieu thereof) available with respect to the income taxes of a possession of the United States, and

“(2) relief in the form of the exclusion under section 911 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1954.


“(b) If the Government of Palau subjects income to taxation substantially similar to that imposed by the Trust Territory Code in effect on January 1, 1980, such Government shall be deemed to have exercised the authority described in Section 254(a).
