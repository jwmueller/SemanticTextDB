§ 17095. Cost-effective technology acceleration program(a) Definition of AdministratorIn this section, the term “Administrator” means the Administrator of General Services.


(b) Establishment(1) In generalThe Administrator shall establish a program to accelerate the use of more cost-effective technologies and practices at GSA facilities.


(2) RequirementsThe program established under this subsection shall—(A) ensure centralized responsibility for the coordination of cost reduction-related recommendations, practices, and activities of all relevant Federal agencies;

(B) provide technical assistance and operational guidance to applicable tenants to achieve the goal identified in subsection (c)(2)(B)(ii);

(C) establish methods to track the success of Federal departments and agencies with respect to that goal; and

(D) be fully coordinated with and no less stringent nor less energy-conserving or water-conserving than required by other provisions of this Act and other applicable law, including sections 321 through 324, 431 through 438, 461, 511 through 518, and 523 through 525 and amendments made by those sections.



(c) Accelerated use of technologies(1) Review(A) In generalAs part of the program under this section, not later than 90 days after December 19, 2007, the Administrator shall conduct a review of—(i) current use of cost-effective lighting technologies and geothermal heat pumps in GSA facilities; and

(ii) the availability to managers of GSA facilities of cost-effective lighting technologies and geothermal heat pumps.


(B) RequirementsThe review under subparagraph (A) shall—(i) examine the use of cost-effective lighting technologies, geothermal heat pumps, and other cost-effective technologies and practices by Federal agencies in GSA facilities; and

(ii) as prepared in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, identify cost-effective lighting technology and geothermal heat pump technology standards that could be used for all types of GSA facilities.



(2) Replacement(A) In generalAs part of the program under this section, not later than 180 days after December 19, 2007, the Administrator shall establish, using available appropriations and programs implementing sections 432 and 525 11 See References in Text note below. (and amendments made by those sections), a cost-effective lighting technology and geothermal heat pump technology acceleration program to achieve maximum feasible replacement of existing lighting, heating, cooling 22 So in original. Probably should be “and cooling”. technologies with cost-effective lighting technologies and geothermal heat pump technologies in each GSA facility. Such program shall fully comply with the requirements of sections 321 through 324, 431 through 438, 461, 511 through 518, and 523 through 525 1 and amendments made by those sections and any other provisions of law, which shall be applicable to the extent that they are more stringent or would achieve greater energy savings than required by this section.


(B) Acceleration plan timetable(i) In generalTo implement the program established under subparagraph (A), not later than 1 year after December 19, 2007, the Administrator shall establish a timetable of actions to comply with the requirements of this section and sections 431 through 435, whichever achieves greater energy savings most expeditiously, including milestones for specific activities needed to replace existing lighting, heating, cooling 2 technologies with cost-effective lighting technologies and geothermal heat pump technologies, to the maximum extent feasible (including at the maximum rate feasible), at each GSA facility.


(ii) GoalThe goal of the timetable under clause (i) shall be to complete, using available appropriations and programs implementing sections 431 through 435 1 (and amendments made by those sections), maximum feasible replacement of existing lighting, heating, and cooling technologies with cost-effective lighting technologies and geothermal heat pump technologies consistent with the requirements of this section and sections 431 through 435,1 whichever achieves greater energy savings most expeditiously. Notwithstanding any provision of this section, such program shall fully comply with the requirements of the Act 33 So in original. Probably should be “this Act”. including sections 321 through 324, 431 through 438, 461, 511 through 518, and 523 through 525 and amendments made by those sections and other provisions of law, which shall be applicable to the extent that they are more stringent or would achieve greater energy or water savings than required by this section.





(d) GSA facility technologies and practices(1) In generalNot later than 180 days after December 19, 2007, and annually thereafter, the Administrator shall—(A) ensure that a manager responsible for implementing section 432 1 and for accelerating the use of cost-effective technologies and practices is designated for each GSA facility; and

(B) submit to Congress a plan to comply with section 432,1 this section, and other applicable provisions of this Act and applicable law with respect to energy and water conservation at GSA facilities.


(2) MeasuresThe plan shall implement measures required by such other provisions of law in accordance with those provisions, and shall implement the measures required by this section to the maximum extent feasible (including at the maximum rate feasible) using available appropriations and programs implementing sections 431 through 435 and 525 1 (and amendments made by those sections), by not later than the date that is 5 years after December 19, 2007.


(3) Contents of planThe plan shall—(A) with respect to cost-effective technologies and practices—(i) identify the specific activities needed to comply with sections 431 through 435; 1

(ii) identify the specific activities needed to achieve at least a 20-percent reduction in operational costs through the application of cost-effective technologies and practices from 2003 levels at GSA facilities by not later than 5 years after December 19, 2007;

(iii) describe activities required and carried out to estimate the funds necessary to achieve the reduction described in clauses (i) and (ii);


(B) include an estimate of the funds necessary to carry out this section;

(C) describe the status of the implementation of cost-effective technologies and practices at GSA facilities, including—(i) the extent to which programs, including the program established under subsection (b), are being carried out in accordance with this part; and

(ii) the status of funding requests and appropriations for those programs;


(D) identify within the planning, budgeting, and construction processes, all types of GSA facility-related procedures that inhibit new and existing GSA facilities from implementing cost-effective technologies;

(E) recommend language for uniform standards for use by Federal agencies in implementing cost-effective technologies and practices;

(F) in coordination with the Office of Management and Budget, review the budget process for capital programs with respect to alternatives for—(i) implementing measures that will assure that Federal agencies retain all identified savings accrued as a result of the use of cost-effective technologies, consistent with section 8253(a)(1) of this title, and other applicable law; and

(ii) identifying short- and long-term cost savings that accrue from the use of cost-effective technologies and practices;


(G) with respect to cost-effective technologies and practices, achieve substantial operational cost savings through the application of the technologies; and

(H) include recommendations to address each of the matters, and a plan for implementation of each recommendation, described in subparagraphs (A) through (G).


(4) AdministrationNotwithstanding any provision of this section, the program required under this section shall fully comply with the requirements of sections 321 through 324, 431 through 438, 461, 511 through 518, and 523 through 525 1 and amendments made by those sections, which shall be applicable to the extent that they are more stringent or would achieve greater energy or water savings than required by this section.
