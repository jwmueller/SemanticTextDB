“It is the sense of the Congress that—
“(1) homelessness is a significant problem in the veterans community and veterans are disproportionately represented among homeless men;

“(3) the most effective programs for the assistance of homeless veterans should be identified and expanded;

“(4) federally funded programs for homeless veterans should be held accountable for achieving clearly defined results;

“(5) Federal efforts to assist homeless veterans should include prevention of homelessness; and

“(6) Federal agencies, particularly the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Department of Labor, should cooperate more fully to address the problem of homelessness among veterans.”
