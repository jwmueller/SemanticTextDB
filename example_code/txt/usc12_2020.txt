References in TextThis title, referred to in subsec. (b)(1), is title X of Pub. L. 111–203, July 21, 2010, 124 Stat. 1955, known as the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, which enacted this subchapter and enacted, amended, and repealed numerous other sections and notes in the Code.

Section 4302(d), referred to in subsec. (b)(2)(B), probably was a reference to section 4302(d) of the House Engrossed version of H.R. 4173, 111th Congress. A later version of H.R. 4173 was enacted as Pub. L. 111–203, and as so enacted, doesn’t contain a section 4302. However, section 1032(f) of Pub. L. 111–203, which is classified to section 5532(f) of this title, contains substantially similar provisions to the section 4302(d) that was probably referred to.
