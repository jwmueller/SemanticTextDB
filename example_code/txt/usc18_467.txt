(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 758; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(G), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on sections 241a, 244a, of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians (Mar. 1, 1895, ch. 145, § 8, 28 Stat. 697; Mar. 5, 1934, ch. 43, 48 Stat. 396.)
Section consolidates sections 241a and 244a of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians. The effect of section 244a of said title in repealing section 241a of said title, except as to lands upon which Indian schools are maintained, was to continue prohibiting the dispensing of liquor in such areas.
The words “upon conviction thereof” were omitted as unnecessary, since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.
The minimum punishment provision was omitted to conform to the policy adopted in revision of the 1909 Criminal Code.
Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.
The exception of intoxicating liquor for scientific, sacramental, medicinal or mechanical purposes was inserted for the same reason that makes this exception appropriate to section 1262 of this title.
Minor changes were made in phraseology.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $500”.
