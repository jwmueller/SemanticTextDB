In this chapter, the words “liquefied natural gas” are substituted for “LNG” for clarity. The word “authority” is substituted for “agency” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words “gas” and “hazardous liquid” are added where applicable because of the restatement.
In subsection (a), before clause (1), the text of 49 App.:1671(10) and 2001(11) is omitted because the complete name of the Secretary of Transportation is used the first time the term appears in a section. The words “As used” are omitted as surplus. In clause (1)(A), the words “Federal Energy Regulatory Commission” and “Commission” are substituted for “Department of Energy” because under 42:7171(a) and 7172(a)(1) the Commission is statutorily independent of the Department and has the responsibility for siting, construction, and operating applications. In clauses (3) and (5), the words “without limitation, new and existing” are omitted as surplus. In clause (4)(B), the words “or material” are omitted as surplus. In clause (6), before subclause (A), the word “pipeline” is substituted for “transmission” for clarity and consistency. In clause (8)(A), before subclause (i), the words “trade, traffic, transportation, exchange, or other” are omitted as surplus. In subclause (ii), the words “trade, transportation, exchange, or other” are omitted as surplus. In clause (8)(B), the word “place” is substituted for “point” for clarity and consistency in the revised title. In clause (9), before subclause (A), the word “facility” is substituted for “transportation” for clarity and consistency. In clause (12), the words “resulting from” and the text of 49 App.:1671(16)(A)–(D) are omitted as surplus. In clause (13), the words “(liquefaction or solidification)” and “(vaporization)” are omitted as surplus. In clauses (14) and (16), the word “pipeline” is added for clarity. In clause (15), the words “city, county, or any other” are omitted as surplus. In clause (17), the words “in addition to its meaning under section 1 of title 1 (except as to societies)” are substituted for “any individual, firm, joint venture, partnership, corporation, association . . . cooperative association, or joint stock association” to eliminate unnecessary words, for clarity, and for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. Clauses (18) and (19) are added because of the restatement. In clause (20), the words “of the United States” are substituted for “of the several” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. In clause (21)(B), the words “outside a populated area” are substituted for “which lie outside the limits of any incorporated or unincorporated city, town, village, or any other designated residential or commercial area such as a subdivision, a business or shopping center, a community development, or any similar populated area” to eliminate unnecessary words.
