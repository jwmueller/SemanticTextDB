In the section, before clause (1), the word “engraved” is added before “portrait” because of the restatement. The words “in the possession” are substituted for “which is now, or may be a part of the engraved stock” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “An impression shall be provided” are added because of the restatement. In clause (1)(A), the words “member of Congress” are substituted for “Senator, Representative, or Delegate in Congress” for consistency. In clause (1)(B), the word “agency” is substituted for “department or bureau” because of section 101 of the revised title and for consistency in the revised title. In clause (2), the words “for a charge and under conditions the Secretary decides are” are substituted for “at such rates and under such conditions as he may deem” for consistency.
