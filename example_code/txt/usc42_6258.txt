§ 10361. Findings
Congress finds that—(1) adequate and safe supplies of water are fundamental to the health, economy, security, and ecology of the United States;

(2) systematic data-gathering with respect to, and research and development of, the water resources of the United States will help ensure the continued existence of sufficient quantities of water to support—(A) increasing populations;

(B) economic growth;

(C) irrigated agriculture;

(D) energy production; and

(E) the protection of aquatic ecosystems;


(3) global climate change poses a significant challenge to the protection and use of the water resources of the United States due to an increased uncertainty with respect to the timing, form, and geographical distribution of precipitation, which may have a substantial effect on the supplies of water for agricultural, hydroelectric power, industrial, domestic supply, and environmental needs;

(4) although States bear the primary responsibility and authority for managing the water resources of the United States, the Federal Government should support the States, as well as regional, local, and tribal governments, by carrying out—(A) nationwide data collection and monitoring activities;

(B) relevant research; and

(C) activities to increase the efficiency of the use of water in the United States;


(5) Federal agencies that conduct water management and related activities have a responsibility—(A) to take a lead role in assessing risks to the water resources of the United States (including risks posed by global climate change); and

(B) to develop strategies—(i) to mitigate the potential impacts of each risk described in subparagraph (A); and

(ii) to help ensure that the long-term water resources management of the United States is sustainable and will ensure sustainable quantities of water;



(6) it is critical to continue and expand research and monitoring efforts—(A) to improve the understanding of the variability of the water cycle; and

(B) to provide basic information necessary—(i) to manage and efficiently use the water resources of the United States; and

(ii) to identify new supplies of water that are capable of being reclaimed; and



(7) the study of water use is vital—(A) to the understanding of the impacts of human activity on water and ecological resources; and

(B) to the assessment of whether available surface and groundwater supplies will be available to meet the future needs of the United States.
