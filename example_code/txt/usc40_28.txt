In subsection (a)(1)(B), the words “from time to time” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “Director of the Office of Management and Budget” are substituted for “Director of the Bureau of the Budget” in section 206(a)(2) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 because the office of Director of the Bureau of the Budget was redesignated the Director of the Office of Management and Budget by section 102(b) of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (eff. July 1, 1970, 84 Stat. 2085). Section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970, was repealed by section 5(b) of the Act of September 13, 1982 (Public Law 97–258, 96 Stat. 1085), the first section of which enacted Title 31, United States Code, but the successor provision, 31:502, continued the designation as Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
In subsection (a)(1)(D), the words “Subject to regulations” are substituted for “subject to regulations and regulations” in section 206(a)(4) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to correct an error resulting from an inconsistency between section 8(d)(1) and section 9(a)(2) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act Amendments of 1983 (Public Law 98–191, 97 Stat. 1331).
In subsection (a)(2)(A), the words “Department of Defense” are substituted for “National Military Establishment” in section 206(a) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 because the Department of Defense is deemed to succeed the National Military Establishment under section 12(a) and (g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (ch. 412, 63 Stat. 591).
In subsection (c), the words “Comptroller General” are substituted for “General Accounting Office” because of 31:702 and for consistency in the revised title.

Amendments2011—Subsec. (a)(1)(D). Pub. L. 111–350 substituted “division B (except sections 1704 and 2303) of subtitle I of title 41” for “the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 401 et seq.)”.
