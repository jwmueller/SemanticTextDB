In no case shall the reduction by reason of this paragraph operate to reduce such portion to an amount less than $10.

(10)(i) If for any month the unreduced annuity provided under this section for a widow or widower is less than the widow’s or widower’s initial minimum amount computed pursuant to paragraph (ii) of this subdivision, the unreduced annuity shall be increased to that initial minimum amount.
