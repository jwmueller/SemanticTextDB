DerivationU.S. CodeRevised Statutes andStatutes at Large


 5 U.S.C. 637.Jan. 16, 1883, ch. 27, § 5, 22 Stat. 405.


The section is rewritten to conform to the style of title 18. The words “a member or employee of the United States Civil Service Commission” are coextensive with and substituted for “Civil Service Commissioner, examiner, copyist, or messenger”.
The references to actions in concert with others to violate this section are omitted in view of the crime of conspiracy contained in chapter 19 of title 18.
In paragraph (1), the words “the rules prescribed by the President under title 5 for the administration of the competitive service and the regulations prescribed by the Commission under section 1302(a) of title 5” are substituted for “any such rules or regulations” to provide the basis of reference.
The words “be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor” are omitted as unnecessary in view of the definitive section 1 of this title. (See reviser’s note under 18 U.S.C. 212, 1964 ed.)
The words “and upon conviction thereof” are omitted as unnecessary because punishment can be imposed only after conviction.
The words “or both” are substituted for “or by both such fine and imprisonment”.

Amendments1996—Pub. L. 104–294 substituted “fined under this title not less than $100” for “fined not less than $100 nor more than $1,000” in concluding provisions.
1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “Office of Personnel Management” for “Civil Service Commission” in introductory provisions and “such Office” for “the Commission” in par. (1).
