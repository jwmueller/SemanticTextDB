In subsection (a)(1), the words “The board of directors is the governing body of the corporation” are added for consistency in the revised title.
In subsection (a)(3), the words “The term of office of a director is 2 years” are substituted for “Each member of the Board of Directors shall serve for a term of two years”, and the words “A director may be reappointed” are substituted for “Members of the Board of Directors are eligible for reappointment”, for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsection (b)(1), the words “an individual to serve as” are omitted as unnecessary.
In subsection (b)(2), before clause (A), the words “is responsible for” are substituted for “shall be responsible for the performance of” to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (B), the words “duties of the corporation under subchapter II of this chapter” are substituted for “functions described in section 5502” because subchapter II of this chapter restates 36:5502–5504 and 5507 and all of these sections provide for duties of the corporation that are the responsibility of the Director of Civilian Marksmanship.
