“Congress makes the following findings:

“(B) The Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 (22 U.S.C. 7501 et seq.) contains provisions that provide for flexibility in the provision of assistance for Afghanistan and are not subject to the requirements of typical foreign assistance programs and provide for the designation of a coordinator to oversee United States assistance for Afghanistan.”
