Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 408, 414(b), (c), 417, 419a(a) (Oct. 29, 1919, ch. 89, § 2(a), 41 Stat. 324; May 22, 1934, ch. 333, §§ 2(b), (c), 5, 48 Stat. 794, 795; Aug. 3, 1939, ch. 413, § 3, 53 Stat. 1178; Aug. 18, 1941, ch. 366, § 2(a), 55 Stat. 631; Sept. 24, 1945, ch. 383, § 1, 59 Stat. 536).
The definitive provisions in each of said sections were separated therefrom and consolidated into this one section defining terms used in this chapter.
The definitions of “interstate or foreign commerce”, contained in said section 408 and in sections 414(a) and 419a(b) of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in section 10 of this title.
Other provisions of section 408 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 2312 and 2313 of this title.
In the definition of “motor vehicle”, words “designed for running on land but not on rails” were substituted for “not designed for running on rails” so as to conform with the ruling in the case of McBoyle v. U.S. (1931, 51 S. Ct. 340, 283, U. S. 25, 75 L. Ed. 816), in which the Supreme Court held that “vehicle” is limited to vehicles running on land and that motor vehicle does not include an airplane.
In the paragraph defining “value” which came from said section 417 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., words “In the event that a defendant is charged in the same indictment with two or more violations of sections 413–419 of this title, then” were omitted and the same meaning was preserved by the substitution of the words “a single” for the word “such.”
Minor changes were made in phraseology.

2002—Pub. L. 107–273 substituted semicolon for period at end of third par.
