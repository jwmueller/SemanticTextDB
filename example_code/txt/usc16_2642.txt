“SEC. 610. WILDERNESS STUDY AREA.“In furtherance of the purposes of the Wilderness Act [16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.], if the land exchange directed by this Act is consummated, the area of land comprising approximately 15,000 acres, as generally depicted on a map entitled ‘Alpine Lakes Wilderness Study Area’, dated October 1998, shall be reviewed by the Secretary of Agriculture as to its suitability for preservation as wilderness. The Secretary shall submit a report and findings to the President, and the President shall submit his recommendations to the United States House of Representatives and United States Senate no later than three years after the first date on which deeds are exchanged to consummate the land exchange. Subject to valid existing rights and existing uses, such lands shall, until Congress determines otherwise or until December 31, 2003, be administered by the Secretary to maintain their wilderness character existing as of the date of enactment of this Act and potential for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System, and shall be withdrawn from all forms of entry and appropriation under the U.S. mining and mineral leasing laws, including the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 [30 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.].
