In this section, the words “department, agency, or instrumentality” are substituted for “department, board, bureau, or agency” for consistency in the revised title. The words “the inspection of vessels” are substituted for “the steamboat inspection service” because the Steamboat Inspection Service has been abolished and its functions are now carried out by the Coast Guard.
In subsection (a), the word “shall” is substituted for “is authorized and directed” for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words.
