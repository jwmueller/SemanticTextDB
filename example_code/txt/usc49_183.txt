In this section, the words “may not” are substituted for “it shall be a violation” and “It shall be unlawful” for consistency in the revised title.
In subsection (a), the words “After the date on which the Secretary of Transportation issues final regulations to enforce this section” are omitted because of section 5907(b) of the revised title. The words “to fail to comply with paragraph (1) or (2)” are omitted as unnecessary because the failure to comply with an affirmative duty is a violation without the need to say so specifically. The word “false” is omitted as included in “erroneous”. The word “written” is omitted as surplus.
In subsection (b), the words “(as such term is defined in section 10102 of this title)” are omitted as unnecessary because of section 5901(1) of the revised title. The word “transport” is substituted for “provide transportation of” for consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words.
