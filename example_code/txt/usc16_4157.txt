“SEC. 6. RELATIONSHIP TO THE MAGNUSON-STEVENS ACT.“(a) In General.—Consistent with section 301(a) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (16 U.S.C. 1851(a)), a single fishery cooperative approved under section 2 of this Act is intended to enhance conservation and sustainable fishery management, reduce and minimize bycatch, promote social and economic benefits, and improve the vessel safety of the longline catcher processor subsector in the BSAI.

“(b) Transition Rule.—A single fishery cooperative approved under section 2 of this Act is deemed to meet the requirements of section 303A(i) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (16 U.S.C. 1853a(i)) as if it had been approved by the Secretary within 6 months after the date of enactment of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 [Pub. L. 109–479, approved Jan. 12, 2007], unless the Secretary makes a determination, within 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act [Dec. 22, 2010], that application of section 303A(i) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act to the cooperative approved under section 2 of this Act would be inconsistent with the purposes for which section 303A was added to the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

“(c) Cost Recovery.—Consistent with section 304(d)(2) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (16 U.S.C. 1854(d)(2)), the Secretary is authorized to recover reasonable costs to administer a single fishery cooperative approved under section 2 of this Act.
