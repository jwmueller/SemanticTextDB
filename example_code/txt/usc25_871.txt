(c) Application groupingsUpon receipt of applications filed pursuant to this section, the Commissioner shall group them in the following order:(A) Applicants who are determined to be at least 50 per centum disabled as certified by a physician approved by the Commissioner. Such applicants shall be ranked in the order of the severity of their disability.

(e) Area; allowable livestock; assistance by Secretary in feeding livestockEach life estate lease shall consist of a fenced area not exceeding ninety acres of land which shall include the life tenant’s present residence and may be used by the life tenant to feed not to exceed twenty-five sheep units per year or equivalent livestock. The Secretary, under existing authority, shall make available to life estate tenants such assistance during that tenure, as may be necessary to enable such tenant to feed such livestock at an adequate nutritional level.


(f) Individuals permitted to reside; regulationsNo person may reside on a life estate other than the life tenant, his or her spouse, and minor dependents, and/or such persons who are necessarily present to provide for the care of the life tenant. The Commissioner shall promulgate regulations to carry out the intent of this subsection.

(h) Relocation benefits upon voluntary relinquishment; compensation upon death of life tenant or surviving spouse; relocation of dependentsNothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting any such applicant who receives a life estate lease under this section from relinquishing, prior to its termination, such estate at any time and voluntarily relocating.
