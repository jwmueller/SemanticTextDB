“SEC. 4001. FINDINGS.“Congress finds the following:“(1) In July 1995, President Bill Clinton announced the formal normalization of diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam.

“(2) Vietnam has taken cooperative steps with the United States under the United States Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (formerly the Joint Task Force-Full Accounting) established in 1992 by President George H.W. Bush to provide the fullest possible accounting of MIA and POW cases.

“(3) In 2000, the United States and Vietnam concluded a bilateral trade agreement that included commitments on goods, services, intellectual property rights, and investment. The agreement was approved by joint resolution enacted pursuant to section 405(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2435(c)), and entered into force in December 2001.

“(4) Since 2001, normal trade relations treatment has consistently been extended to Vietnam pursuant to title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.].

“(5) Vietnam has undertaken significant market-based economic reforms, including the reduction of government subsidies, tariffs and nontariff barriers, and extensive legal reform. These measures have dramatically improved Vietnam’s business and investment climate.

“(6) Vietnam has completed its negotiations to join the World Trade Organization (WTO). On May 31, 2006, the United States and Vietnam signed a comprehensive bilateral agreement providing greater market access for goods and services and other trade liberalizing commitments. On November 7, 2006, the WTO General Council approved Vietnam’s membership. Vietnam’s National Assembly ratified Vietnam’s WTO accession commitments on November 28, 2006, and Vietnam will become the 150th Member of the WTO 30 days thereafter.

“(7) On November 13, 2006, the Department of State removed Vietnam from its list of Countries of Particular Concern (CPC) for severe violations of religious freedom. In reaching this determination, the Department of State cited significant improvements in Vietnam toward advancing religious freedom, though problems remain that merit immediate attention and important work remains to be done to fully protect religious freedom in Vietnam.
