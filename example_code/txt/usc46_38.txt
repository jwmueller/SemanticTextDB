References in TextThe Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, referred to in subsec. (b)(5), is Pub. L. 101–508, Nov. 5, 1990, 104 Stat. 1388. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Tables.

Amendments2006—Subsec. (a)(2). Pub. L. 109–304, § 15(6)(A), substituted “part B of this subtitle” for “part B of this title”.
Subsec. (b)(2)(A)(iii). Pub. L. 109–304, § 15(6)(B), substituted “; and” for period at end.
Subsec. (b)(5). Pub. L. 109–304, § 15(6)(C), substituted “The fee” for “The fees”.
Subsec. (f). Pub. L. 109–304, § 15(6)(D), substituted “Secretary of Homeland Security shall deny the clearance required by section 60105 of this title” for “Secretary of the Treasury shall deny the clearance required by section 4197 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (46 App. U.S.C. 91)”.
Subsec. (j). Pub. L. 109–304, § 15(6)(E), substituted “State” for “state”.
2002—Subsec. (k). Pub. L. 107–295 substituted “2006” for “2001”.
1998—Subsec. (k). Pub. L. 105–383 added subsec. (k).
1996—Subsec. (a)(2). Pub. L. 104–324, § 1112, which directed amendment of section 10401(g) of Pub. L. 101–508 by inserting “The Secretary may not establish a fee or charge under paragraph (1) for inspection or examination of a small passenger vessel under this title that is more than $300 annually for such vessels under 65 feet in length, or more than $600 annually for such vessels 65 feet in length and greater. The Secretary may not establish a fee or charge under paragraph (1) for inspection or examination under this title for any publicly-owned ferry.” after “annually.”, was executed by making insertion in subsec. (a)(2) of this section to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because section 10401(a) of Pub. L. 101–508 amended this section generally, and section 10401 of Pub. L. 101–508 did not contain a subsec. (g).
1992—Subsec. (b)(1). Pub. L. 102–582, § 501(a)(1), substituted “1993 and 1994” for “1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995” and “to which paragraph (2) of this subsection applies” for “that is greater than 16 feet in length”.
Subsec. (b)(2). Pub. L. 102–582, § 501(a)(2), amended par. (2) generally. Prior to amendment, par. (2) read as follows: “The fee or charge established under paragraph (1) of this subsection is as follows:

1990—Pub. L. 101–508, as amended by Pub. L. 104–324, substituted “Fees” for “Fees prohibited” as section catchline and amended text generally.
