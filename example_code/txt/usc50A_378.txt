§ 1941n. Basis for negotiating sale of a facility
In arriving at its recommendations for the disposal of the facilities, the Commission shall use, as the basis for negotiating the sale of each facility the highest amount proposed to be paid for each facility, if, in the opinion of the Commission, the highest amount proposed to be paid was a bona fide proposal and was submitted by a person competent to operate a rubber-producing facility: Provided, That the words “competent to operate a rubber-producing facility” shall not be interpreted so as to require prior experience in the operation of a rubber-producing facility: Provided further, That in using such highest proposed amount as a basis for negotiations the Commission may negotiate with respect to any facility with any person who submitted a proposal on that or any similar facility and may recommend sale of any facility to any person who submitted a proposal on that or any similar facility at a price which is equal to, higher than, or lower than the highest amount proposed to be paid for each facility as the Commission determines will best effectuate the purposes of this Act [sections 1941 to 1941y of this Appendix].
