ADDITIONAL PROCLAMATION AUTHORITY.“(a) Elimination or Modifications of Duties.—The President is authorized to proclaim elimination or modification of any existing duty as the President determines is necessary to exempt any article from duty if—“(1) that article is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, or a qualifying industrial zone or is a new or different article of commerce that has been grown, produced, or manufactured in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, or a qualifying industrial zone;

“(2) that article is imported directly from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Israel, or a qualifying industrial zone; and

“(3) the sum of—“(A) the cost or value of the materials produced in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Israel, or a qualifying industrial zone, plus
