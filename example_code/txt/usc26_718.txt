“(g) Definitions.—For purposes of this section—“(1) Depreciation.—The term ‘depreciation’ means exhaustion, wear and tear, and obsolescence.

“(2) Changeover.—The term ‘changeover’ means a change from the retirement to the straight line method of computing the allowance of deductions for depreciation.
