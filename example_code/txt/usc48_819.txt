“ ‘(a) Extension of Section 936 to the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia.—For purposes of section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia shall be treated as if they were possessions of the United States.
“ ‘(b) Exchange of Information.—Subsection (a) shall not apply to the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia (as the case may be) for any period after December 31, 1986, during which there is not in effect between the appropriate government and the United States an exchange of information agreement of the kind described in section 274(h)(6)(C) (other than clause (ii) thereof) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
“ ‘(c) Procedure If Section 936 Incentives Reduced.—If the tax incentives extended to the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia under subsection (a) are, at any time during which the Compact is in effect, reduced, the Secretary of the Treasury shall negotiate an agreement with the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia under which, when such agreement is approved by law, they will be provided with benefits substantially equivalent to such reduction in benefits. If, within the 1 year period after the date of the enactment of the Act making the reduction in benefits, an agreement negotiated under the preceding sentence is not approved by law, the matter shall be submitted to the Arbitration Board established pursuant to section 424 of the Compact. For purposes of Article V of Title Two of the Compact, the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate shall be the member of such Board representing the Government of the United States.
