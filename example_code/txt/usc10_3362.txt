“SEC. 1115. INITIAL ENTRY TRAINING AND NONDEPLOYABLE PERSONNEL ACCOUNT.“(a) Establishment of Personnel Account.—The Secretary of the Army shall establish a personnel accounting category for members of the Army Selected Reserve to be used for categorizing members of the Selected Reserve who have not completed the minimum training required for deployment or who are otherwise not available for deployment. The account shall be designed so that it is compatible with the decentralized personnel systems of the Army Guard and Reserve. The account shall be used for the reporting of personnel readiness and may not be used as a factor in establishing the level of Army Guard and Reserve force structure.

“(b) Use of Account.—Until a member of the Army Selected Reserve has completed the minimum training necessary for deployment, the member may not be assigned to fill a position in a Selected Reserve unit but shall be carried in the account established under subsection (a).

“(c) Time for Qualification for Deployment.—(1) If at the end of 24 months after a member of the Army Selected Reserve enters the Army Selected Reserve, the member has not completed the minimum training required for deployment, the member shall be discharged.

“(2) The Secretary of the Army may waive the requirement in paragraph (1) in the case of health care providers and in other cases determined necessary. The authority to make such a waiver may not be delegated.
