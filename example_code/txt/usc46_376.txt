Historical and Revision NotesRevised section 12503
Subsection (a) of section 12503 allows a State or approved State delegee to make vessel identification information available to the Secretary. Participation in the system is voluntary on the part of a State. A benefit to boat purchasers and financiers in States with approved titling systems participating in this system is that vessel mortgages or financing instruments made in those States are deemed to be preferred mortgages under chapter 313 of title 46, United States Code (as codified and enacted by this Act).
Under subsection (a), the Secretary may prescribe the manner and form in which the information is made available by the States. In this regard, the Committee intends that the Secretary employ the most efficient, up-to-date computer technology in maintaining information made available from the States to avoid duplication of effort in maintaining information and to reduce the costs of the system. In addition to the vessel identification information made available by States under paragraphs (1)–(6), the Secretary and a State may agree that the State make available other information. For example, the purpose for which a vessel is routinely used would be valuable information for the system.
The Committee intends that most of the information in the system will become available directly and exclusively from the States to the greatest extent possible. However, under subsection (b), the Secretary may accept information from others under conditions and in a manner and form prescribed by the Secretary. Thus, if the Secretary discovers a valuable and reliable source of data that can be conveniently made available to the system, the Secretary can approve it.
Under paragraph (c)(1), the Secretary must maintain information on a State-titled vessel with a preferred mortgage that moves to a nonparticipating, nontitle State, until the mortgage is discharged or the vessel is sold. Under paragraph (c)(2), the Secretary must accept information submitted under section 31321 of title 46 (as enacted by this Act) concerning a discharge of a preferred mortgage on a vessel title under State law. This would be necessary if the vessel moves to a nonparticipating State, and information on that vessel would not be provided to the system by that State. This subsection will allow the Secretary to keep the vessel information system current on these matters and purge files no longer required to be maintained.
