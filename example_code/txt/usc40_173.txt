(2) when a violation of clause (1) occurs, the contractor and any subcontractor responsible for the violation are liable—(A) to the affected employee for the employee’s unpaid wages; and

(B) to the Government, the District of Columbia, or a territory for liquidated damages as provided in the contract.



(c) Liquidated Damages.—Liquidated damages under subsection (b)(2)(B) shall be computed for each individual employed as a laborer or mechanic in violation of this chapter and shall be equal to $10 for each calendar day on which the individual was required or permitted to work in excess of the standard workweek without payment of the overtime wages required by this chapter.

(d) Amounts Withheld To Satisfy Liabilities.—Subject to section 3703 of this title, the governmental agency for which the contract work is done or which is providing financial assistance for the work may withhold, or have withheld, from money payable because of work performed by a contractor or subcontractor, amounts administratively determined to be necessary to satisfy the liabilities of the contractor or subcontractor for unpaid wages and liquidated damages as provided in this section.
