§ 9505. Performance awards for senior executives(a) Before September 30, 2013, Internal Revenue Service senior executives who have program management responsibility over significant functions of the Internal Revenue Service may be paid a performance bonus without regard to the limitation in section 5384(b)(2) if the Secretary of the Treasury finds such award warranted based on the executive’s performance.

(b) In evaluating an executive’s performance for purposes of an award under this section, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take into account the executive’s contributions toward the successful accomplishment of goals and objectives established under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, subtitle III of title 40, Revenue Procedure 64–22 (as in effect on July 30, 1997), taxpayer service surveys, and other performance metrics or plans established in consultation with the Internal Revenue Service Oversight Board.

(c) Any award in excess of 20 percent of an executive’s rate of basic pay shall be approved by the Secretary of the Treasury.

(d) Notwithstanding section 5384(b)(3), the Secretary of the Treasury shall determine the aggregate amount of performance awards available to be paid during any fiscal year under this section and section 5384 to career senior executives in the Internal Revenue Service. Such amount may not exceed the maximum amount which would be allowable under paragraph (3) of section 5384(b) if such paragraph were applied by substituting “the Internal Revenue Service” for “an agency”. The Internal Revenue Service shall not be included in the determination under section 5384(b)(3) of the aggregate amount of performance awards payable to career senior executives in the Department of the Treasury other than the Internal Revenue Service.

(e) Notwithstanding section 5307, a performance bonus award may not be paid to an executive in a calendar year if, or to the extent that, the executive’s total annual compensation will exceed the maximum amount of total annual compensation payable at the rate determined under section 104 of title 3.
