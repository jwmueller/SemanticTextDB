In clause (1), the text of 15:1901(11) is omitted as surplus because the complete title of the Secretary of Transportation is used the first time the term appears in a section. The definition of “property loss reduction standard” is combined with the definition of “bumper standard” because the former term is used only in the definition of the latter term. Before subclause (A), the words “the purpose of which is” and “eliminate” are omitted as surplus. In subclauses (A) and (B), the words “(or both)” are omitted as surplus. In subclause (A), the word “physical” is omitted as surplus.
In clause (2), the words “of passenger motor vehicles” and “engaged” are omitted as surplus.
In clause (5)(A), the words “manufacturing or assembling” are substituted for “engaged in the manufacturing or assembling of” to eliminate unnecessary words.
In clause (8), the words “maintenance or operation” are substituted for “operation, maintenance, or use” to eliminate an unnecessary word.
In clauses (12) and (13), the words “the Northern Mariana Islands” are added because of section 502(a)(2) of the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America, as enacted by the Act of March 24, 1976 (Public Law 94–241, 90 Stat. 268), and as proclaimed to be in effect by the President on January 9, 1978 (Proc. No. 4534, Oct. 24, 1977, 42 F.R. 56593). The words “the Canal Zone” are omitted because of the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977.
In clause (12), the word “means” is substituted for “includes” as being more appropriate. The words “a State of the United States” are substituted for “each of the several States” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.
In clause (13), the words “of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico” are omitted as surplus because the district court of Puerto Rico is a district court of the United States under 28:119.
