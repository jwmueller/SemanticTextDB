(j) Notification of emergency employment of electronic surveillance; contents; postponement, suspension or eliminationIf an emergency employment of electronic surveillance is authorized under section 1805(e) of this title and a subsequent order approving the surveillance is not obtained, the judge shall cause to be served on any United States person named in the application and on such other United States persons subject to electronic surveillance as the judge may determine in his discretion it is in the interest of justice to serve, notice of—(1) the fact of the application;
