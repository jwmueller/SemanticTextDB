§ 7952. Establishment of payment yield and base acres for peanuts for a farm(a) Average yield and acreage average for historic peanut producers(1) Determination of average yield(A) In generalThe Secretary shall determine, for each historic peanut producer, the average yield for peanuts on each farm on which the historic peanut producer planted peanuts for harvest for the 1998 through 2001 crop years, excluding any crop year in which the producer did not plant or was prevented from planting peanuts.


(B) Assigned yieldsFor the purposes of determining the 4-year average yield for an historic peanut producer under this paragraph, the historic peanut producer may elect to substitute for a farm, for not more than 3 of the 1998 through 2001 crop years in which the producer planted peanuts on the farm, the average yield for peanuts produced in the county in which the farm is located for the 1990 through 1997 crop years.



(2) Determination of acreage average(A) In generalThe Secretary shall determine, for each historic peanut producer, the 4-year average of the following:(i) Acreage planted to peanuts on each farm on which the historic peanut producer planted peanuts for harvest for the 1998 through 2001 crop years.

(B) Inclusion of all 4 years in averageFor the purposes of determining the 4-year acreage average for an historic peanut producer under this paragraph, the Secretary shall not exclude any crop year in which the producer did not plant peanuts.


(C) Proportional sharesIf more than 1 historic peanut producer shared in the risk of producing the crop on a farm, the historic peanut producers shall receive their proportional share of the number of acres planted (or prevented from being planted) to peanuts for harvest on the farm based on the sharing arrangement that was in effect among the producers for the crop.



(3) Time for determinationsThe Secretary shall make the determinations required by this subsection as soon as practicable after May 13, 2002.


(4) Special considerationsIn making the determinations required by this subsection, the Secretary shall take into account changes in the number, identity, or interest of producers sharing in the risk of producing a peanut crop since the 1998 crop year, including providing a method for the assignment of average acres and average yield to a farm—(A) when an historic peanut producer is no longer living;

(B) when an entity composed of historic peanut producers has been dissolved; or

(C) in other appropriate situations, as determined by the Secretary.



(b) Assignment of average yields and average acreage to farms(1) Assignment by historic peanut producersThe Secretary shall give each historic peanut producer an opportunity to assign the average peanut yield and average acreage determined under subsection (a) for each farm of the historic peanut producer to cropland on that farm or another farm in the same State or a contiguous State.


(2) Limitation on acreage assignmentNotwithstanding paragraph (1), the average acreage determined under subsection (a)(2) for a farm may not be assigned to a farm in a contiguous State unless—(A) the historic peanut producer making the assignment produced peanuts in that State during at least 1 of the 1998 through 2001 crop years; or

(B) as of March 31, 2003, the historic peanut producer is a producer on a farm in that State.

If an historic peanut producer fails to submit the notice by that date, the notice shall be submitted in such other manner as the Secretary may prescribe.



(c) Payment yieldThe average of all of the yields assigned by historic peanut producers under subsection (b) to a farm shall be considered to be the payment yield for that farm for the purpose of making direct payments and counter-cyclical payments under this subchapter.


(d) Base acres for peanutsSubject to subsection (e), the total number of acres assigned by historic peanut producers under subsection (b) to a farm shall be considered to be the farm’s base acres for peanuts for the purpose of making direct payments and counter-cyclical payments under this subchapter.


(e) Treatment of conservation reserve contract acreage(1) In generalThe Secretary shall provide for an adjustment, as appropriate, in the base acres for peanuts for a farm whenever either of the following circumstances occur:(A) A conservation reserve contract entered into under section 1231 of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3831) with respect to the farm expires or is voluntarily terminated.

(f) Prevention of excess base acres for peanuts(1) Required reductionIf the sum of the base acres for peanuts for a farm, together with the acreage described in paragraph (2), exceeds the actual cropland acreage of the farm, the Secretary shall reduce the base acres for peanuts for the farm or the base acres for 1 or more covered commodities under subchapter I for the farm so that the sum of the base acres for peanuts and acreage described in paragraph (2) does not exceed the actual cropland acreage of the farm.
