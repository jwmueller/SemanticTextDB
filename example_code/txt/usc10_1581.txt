“SEC. 4002. FINDINGS AND POLICY“(a) Findings.—Congress makes the following findings:“(1) There are likely to be significant reductions in the programs, projects, and activities of the Department of Defense during the first several fiscal years following fiscal year 1990.

“(2) Such reductions will adversely affect the economies of many communities in the United States and small businesses and civilian workers throughout the United States.


“(b) Policy.—In view of the findings expressed in subsection (a), it is the policy of the United States that—“(1) assistance be provided under existing planning assistance programs and economic adjustment assistance programs of the Federal Government to substantially and seriously affected communities, businesses, and workers to the extent necessary to facilitate an orderly transition for such communities, small businesses, and workers from economic reliance on Department of Defense spending to economic reliance on other sources of business, employment, and revenue; and

“(2) funding for such programs be increased by amounts necessary to meet the needs of such communities, small businesses, and workers without reducing the funding that would otherwise be available under those programs by reason of causes unrelated to the reductions referred to in subsection (a)(1).
