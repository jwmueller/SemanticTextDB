5330546 App.:1161(b) (1st sentence words after 16th comma).June 29, 1936, ch. 858, title V, § 511(b) (1st sentence words after 16th comma), as added Oct. 10, 1940, ch. 849, 54 Stat. 1106; June 17, 1943, ch. 130, subdiv. (a), 57 Stat. 157; July 17, 1952, ch. 939, § 9, 66 Stat. 762.


In paragraph (3), the words “documented vessel” are substituted for “vessels documented under the laws of the United States” because of the definition of “documented vessel” in chapter 1 of the revised title.
In paragraph (4), the words “interest or other amounts accrued on deposits in the fund” are substituted for “receipts, in the form of interest or otherwise, with respect to amounts previously deposited” for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.
