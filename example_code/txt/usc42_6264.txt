(ii) ensure all streamgages are flood-hardened and equipped with water-quality sensors and modernized telemetry.


(B) Requirements of sitesEach site described in subparagraph (A) shall conform with the National Streamflow Information Program plan as reviewed by the National Research Council.



(5) Federal shareThe Federal share of the national streamgaging network established pursuant to this subsection shall be 100 percent of the cost of carrying out the national streamgaging network.


(6) Authorization of appropriations(A) In generalExcept as provided in subparagraph (B), there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to operate the national streamflow information program for the period of fiscal years 2009 through 2023, to remain available until expended.


(B) Network enhancement fundingThere is authorized to be appropriated to carry out the network enhancements described in paragraph (4) $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2009 through 2019, to remain available until expended.




(b) National groundwater resources monitoring(1) In generalThe Secretary shall develop a systematic groundwater monitoring program for each major aquifer system located in the United States.


(2) Program elementsIn developing the monitoring program described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall—(A) establish appropriate criteria for monitoring wells to ensure the acquisition of long-term, high-quality data sets, including, to the maximum extent possible, the inclusion of real-time instrumentation and reporting;

(B) in coordination with the Advisory Committee and State and local water resource agencies—(i) assess the current scope of groundwater monitoring based on the access availability and capability of each monitoring well in existence as of March 30, 2009; and

(ii) develop and carry out a monitoring plan that maximizes coverage for each major aquifer system that is located in the United States; and


(C) prior to initiating any specific monitoring activities within a State after March 30, 2009, consult and coordinate with the applicable State water resource agency with jurisdiction over the aquifer that is the subject of the monitoring activities, and comply with all applicable laws (including regulations) of the State.


(3) Program objectivesIn carrying out the monitoring program described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall—(A) provide data that is necessary for the improvement of understanding with respect to surface water and groundwater interactions;

(B) by expanding the network of monitoring wells to reach each climate division, support the groundwater climate response network to improve the understanding of the effects of global climate change on groundwater recharge and availability; and

(C) support the objectives of the assessment program.


(4) Improved methodologiesThe Secretary shall—(A) improve methodologies relating to the analysis and delivery of data; and

(B) investigate, develop, and implement new methodologies and technologies to estimate or measure groundwater recharge, discharge, and storage in a more cost-efficient manner.


(5) Federal shareThe Federal share of the monitoring program described in paragraph (1) may be 100 percent of the cost of carrying out the monitoring program.


(6) PriorityIn selecting monitoring activities consistent with the monitoring program described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall give priority to those activities for which a State or local governmental entity agrees to provide for a substantial share of the cost of establishing or operating a monitoring well or other measuring device to carry out a monitoring activity.


(7) Authorization of appropriationsThere are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out this subsection for the period of fiscal years 2009 through 2023, to remain available until expended.



(c) Brackish groundwater assessment(1) StudyThe Secretary, in consultation with State and local water resource agencies, shall conduct a study of available data and other relevant information—(A) to identify significant brackish groundwater resources located in the United States; and

(B) to consolidate any available data relating to each groundwater resource identified under subparagraph (A).


(2) ReportNot later than 2 years after March 30, 2009, the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report that includes—(A) a description of each—(i) significant brackish aquifer that is located in the United States (including 1 or more maps of each significant brackish aquifer that is located in the United States);

(ii) data gap that is required to be addressed to fully characterize each brackish aquifer described in clause (i); and

(iii) current use of brackish groundwater that is supplied by each brackish aquifer described in clause (i); and


(B) a summary of the information available as of March 30, 2009, with respect to each brackish aquifer described in subparagraph (A)(i) (including the known level of total dissolved solids in each brackish aquifer).


(3) Authorization of appropriationsThere is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this subsection $3,000,000 for the period of fiscal years 2009 through 2011, to remain available until expended.



(d) Improved water estimation, measurement, and monitoring technologies(1) Authority of SecretaryThe Secretary may provide grants on a nonreimbursable basis to appropriate entities with expertise in water resource data acquisition and reporting, including Federal agencies, the Water Resources Research Institutes and other academic institutions, and private entities, to—(A) investigate, develop, and implement new methodologies and technologies to estimate or measure water resources data in a cost-efficient manner; and

(B) improve methodologies relating to the analysis and delivery of data.
