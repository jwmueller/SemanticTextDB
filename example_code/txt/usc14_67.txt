Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 15a–1 (May 25, 1943, ch. 99, 57 Stat. 84).
Said section has been divided. The proviso is incorporated in section 182 of this title. The other part is incorporated in this section.
The last sentence of this section is new as a statute; it makes statutory what has been the practice of years, and is similar to the third sentence of title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 1057, applicable to graduates of the Naval Academy. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.
