In subsections (a) and (b), the words “Regardless of whether a tax is imposed under section 60301 of this title” are added for clarity. See 19 C.F.R. § 4.20(c) (2003).
In subsection (a)(1), the word “owned” is substituted for “belonging” for consistency in the revised title.
In subsection (a)(3), the words “vessel of the United States” are substituted for “vessel” for clarity.
In subsection (c), the words “The tax of 50 cents per ton” are substituted for “no such duty” in 46 App. U.S.C. 121 to conform more closely to the language in section 1 of the Act of March 4, 1915 (ch. 171, 38 Stat. 1193). The word “documented” is substituted for “registered” for consistency in the revised title.
The words “In addition to the tonnage-duty above imposed, there shall be paid a tax, at the rate of thirty cents per ton, on vessels which shall be entered at any custom-house within the United States from any foreign port or place” in R.S. § 4219 were omitted from the original codification of R.S. § 4219 in 46 U.S.C. 121 (1926 edition, 44 Stat. 1467). A codification note which first appeared in the 1958 edition of the United States Code for 46 U.S.C. 121 says that the words apparently were omitted as superseded and repealed by section 14 of the Act of June 26, 1884 (ch. 121, 23 Stat. 57), as amended by section 11 of the Act of June 19, 1886 (ch. 421, 24 Stat. 81), and section 1 of the Act of April 4, 1888 (ch. 61, 25 Stat. 80).
