 28 U.S.C. 510.[None].


The words “and at salaries fixed by” are omitted as superseded by the Classification Act of 1949, as amended, which is codified in chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5, United States Code.

1948 ActPrior section 510.—Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 484, 593 (May 28, 1896, ch. 252, § 15, 29 Stat. 183; June 30, 1906, ch. 3914, § 1, 34 Stat. 753; July 19, 1919, ch. 24, § 1, 41 Stat. 209).
Section consolidates and simplifies sections 484 and 593 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. For provisions with respect to classified civil service, see sections 631–684 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees.
Section 593 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related to clerks and messengers in the office of United States attorney, southern district of New York. Section 484 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related to clerical assistants for all United States attorneys. It was not affected by section 678 of title 5 U.S.C. 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees, according to a Department of Justice interpretation.
Provision of said section 593 for office expenses of United States attorneys is covered by section 509 [now 549] of this title.
Said section 593 also required that payment of salaries of such clerks and messengers be made by the disbursing clerk of the Department of Justice. Under section 550 [see Prior Provisions note below] of this title the marshals will make such payments including the office expenses of United States attorneys.
The restriction that section 484 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., did not apply to Alaska is omitted as unnecessary since section 109 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, authorizes employment of clerical assistants to United States attorneys in Alaska by the Attorney General.
The provision in such section 484 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the need for clerical assistants be certified by the district judge, was omitted as unnecessary. The need may be determined by the Attorney General.
Changes were made in phraseology.
