§ 1352. Bonds executed under federal law
The district courts shall have original jurisdiction, concurrent with State courts, of any action on a bond executed under any law of the United States, except matters within the jurisdiction of the Court of International Trade under section 1582 of this title.
(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 934; Pub. L. 96–417, title V, § 506, Oct. 10, 1980, 94 Stat. 1743.)

Historical and Revision NotesThis section is necessary to permit actions in the district courts upon any bond authorized by a law of the United States. In the absence of this new provision, such actions could not be maintained except by the United States, where the amount and other jurisdictional requisites did not exist. The new section also makes clear that it does not affect the right to prosecute such actions in State courts.
