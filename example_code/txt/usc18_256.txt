Words “or any department or agency thereof,” were inserted after “United States” so as to eliminate any possible ambiguity as to scope of section. (See definitive section 6 of this title.)
The smaller punishment for an offense involving $100 or less was added. (See reviser’s note under sections 641, 645 of this title.)
