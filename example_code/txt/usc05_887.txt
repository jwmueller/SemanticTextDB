The words “Compensation awarded” are substituted for “Such compensation as the Secretary may award”.
The last sentence of former section 794, requiring that the Commissioners of the District of Columbia submit to Congress through the Bureau of the Budget estimates of appropriations, is omitted as obsolete. The Budget and Accounting Act, 1921, as amended, 31 U.S.C. 2 et seq., prescribes the procedures for presenting all budget estimates for the government of the District of Columbia and provides that the budget submission to Congress be made by the President.
Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
