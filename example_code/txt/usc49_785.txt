In subsection (a)(1), the words “that violates this chapter” are substituted for “who commits any act or causes to be done any act that violates any provision of this subchapter or omits to do any act or causes to be omitted any act that is required by any such provision” in 15:1990b(a) for consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “or a regulation prescribed or order issued under this chapter” are substituted for “No transferor shall violate any rule prescribed under this section” in 15:1988 for consistency in the revised title and because “rule” is synonymous with “regulations”. The words “A separate violation occurs for each motor vehicle or device involved in the violation” are substituted for “A violation of any such provision shall, for purposes of this section, constitute a separate violation with respect to each motor vehicle or device involved” in 15:1990b(a) to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsection (a)(2), the words “on behalf of the United States” are omitted as surplus. The words “Before compromising the amount of a penalty, the Secretary shall give” are substituted for “after affording” for clarity. The words “to present views and evidence in support thereof” and “alleged” are omitted as surplus.
In subsection (b), the words “that knowingly and willfully violates this chapter” are substituted for “knowingly and willfully commits any act or causes to be done any act that violates any provision of this subchapter or knowingly and willfully omits to do any act or causes to be omitted any act that is required by such provision” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “or a regulation prescribed or order issued under this chapter” are substituted for “No transferor shall violate any rule prescribed under this section” in 15:1988 for consistency in the revised title and because “rule” is synonymous with “regulation”. The words “fined under title 18” are substituted for “fined not more than $50,000” for consistency with title 18. The words “an act in violation of” are substituted for “any of the acts or practices constituting in whole or in part a violation of” to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsections (c) and (d), the word “enjoin” is substituted for “restrain” for consistency.
In subsection (c), the words “The United States district courts shall have jurisdiction” are omitted because of 28:1331. The words “for cause shown and subject to the provisions of rule 65(a) and (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure” are omitted as surplus because the rules apply in the absence of an exemption from them. The words “the violation occurred” are substituted for “wherein any act, omission, or transaction constituting the violation occurred”, and the word “resides” is substituted for “is an inhabitant”, to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “may be served in” are substituted for “may run into” for clarity.
In subsection (d)(1), before clause (A), the words “this chapter or a regulation prescribed or order issued under this chapter” are substituted for “requirement imposed under this subchapter” for consistency. The words “civil action” are substituted for “any action” for consistency with rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.).
In subsection (d)(2), the words “without regard to the amount in controversy” are omitted because jurisdiction is now allowed under 28:1331 without regard to the amount in controversy. The words “United States district court” are substituted for “district court of the United States” for consistency with the definition in section 32101 of the revised title and with other provisions of the chapter.
