(ii) was not received immediately prior to serving in a combat zone.


(D) In the case of a pregnant woman who is otherwise ineligible for participation in the program because the family of the woman is of insufficient size to meet the income eligibility standards of the program, the pregnant woman shall be considered to have satisfied the income eligibility standards if, by increasing the number of individuals in the family of the woman by 1 individual, the income eligibility standards would be met.


(3) Certification.—(A) Procedures.—(i) In general.—Subject to clause (ii), a person shall be certified for participation in accordance with general procedures prescribed by the Secretary.

(ii) Breastfeeding women.—A State may elect to certify a breastfeeding woman for a period of 1 year postpartum or until a woman discontinues breastfeeding, whichever is earlier.

(iii) Children.—A State may elect to certify participant children for a period of up to 1 year, if the State electing the option provided under this clause ensures that participant children receive required health and nutrition assessments.


(B) A State may consider pregnant women who meet the income eligibility standards to be presumptively eligible to participate in the program and may certify the women for participation immediately, without delaying certification until an evaluation is made concerning nutritional risk. A nutritional risk evaluation of such a woman shall be completed not later than 60 days after the woman is certified for participation. If it is subsequently determined that the woman does not meet nutritional risk criteria, the certification of the woman shall terminate on the date of the determination.

(C) Physical presence.—(i) In general.—Except as provided in clause (ii) and subject to the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) and section 794 of title 29, each individual seeking certification or recertification for participation in the program shall be physically present at each certification or recertification determination in order to determine eligibility under the program.

(E) The Secretary shall offer to solicit bids on behalf of State agencies regarding cost-containment contracts to be entered into by infant formula manufacturers and State agencies. The Secretary shall make the offer to State agencies once every 12 months. Each such bid solicitation shall only take place if two or more State agencies request the Secretary to perform the solicitation. For such State agencies, the Secretary shall solicit bids and select the winning bidder for a cost containment contract to be entered into by State agencies and infant formula manufacturers or suppliers.

(F) In soliciting bids for contracts for infant formula for the program authorized by this section, the Secretary shall solicit bids from infant formula manufacturers under procedures in which bids for rebates or discounts are solicited for milk-based and soy-based infant formula, separately, except where the Secretary determines that such solicitation procedures are not in the best interest of the program.

(G) To reduce the costs of any supplemental foods, the Secretary may make available additional funds to State agencies out of the funds otherwise available under paragraph (1)(A) for nutrition services and administration in an amount not exceeding one half of 1 percent of the amounts to help defray reasonable anticipated expenses associated with innovations in cost containment or associated with procedures that tend to enhance competition.

(H)(i) Any person, company, corporation, or other legal entity that submits a bid to supply infant formula to carry out the program authorized by this section and announces or otherwise discloses the amount of the bid, or the rebate or discount practices of such entities, in advance of the time the bids are opened by the Secretary or the State agency, or any person, company, corporation, or other legal entity that makes a statement (prior to the opening of bids) relating to levels of rebates or discounts, for the purpose of influencing a bid submitted by any other person, shall be ineligible to submit bids to supply infant formula to the program for the bidding in progress for up to 2 years from the date the bids are opened and shall be subject to a civil penalty of up to $100,000,000, as determined by the Secretary to provide restitution to the program for harm done to the program.
