“Sec. 102. (a) There are authorized to be appropriated for each of the fiscal years 1981, 1982, and 1983, but only in a lump sum for all programs under this Act, subject to allocation in accordance with subsection (b), such sums as may be necessary to make payments to which State educational agencies are entitled under this Act and payments for administration under section 104.

“(b)(1) If the sums appropriated for any fiscal year to make payments to States under this Act are not sufficient to pay in full the sum of the amounts which State educational agencies are entitled to receive under titles II through IV for such year, the allocations to State educational agencies under each of such titles shall be ratably reduced by the same percentage to the extent necessary to bring the aggregate of such allocations within the limits of the amounts so appropriated.

“(2) In the event that funds become available for making payments under this Act for any period after allocations have been made under paragraph (1) of this subsection for such period, the amounts reduced under such paragraph shall be increased on the same basis as they were reduced.
