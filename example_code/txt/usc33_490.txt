§ 701b–11. Flood protection projects(a) General considerations; nonstructural alternativesIn the survey, planning, or design by any Federal agency of any project involving flood protection, consideration shall be given to nonstructural alternatives to prevent or reduce flood damages including, but not limited to, floodproofing of structures; flood plain regulation; acquisition of flood plain lands for recreational, fish and wildlife, and other public purposes; and relocation with a view toward formulating the most economically, socially, and environmentally acceptable means of reducing or preventing flood damages.


(b) Non-Federal participation through nonstructural alternatives; limitationWhere a nonstructural alternative is recommended, non-Federal participation shall be comparable to the value of lands, easements, and rights-of-way which would have been required of non-Federal interests under section 701c of this title, for structural protection measures, but in no event shall exceed 20 per centum of the project costs.
