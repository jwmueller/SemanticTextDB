The words “disbursing official” are substituted for “disbursing officer” because of the definition of “officer” in section 2104 which excludes a member of a uniformed service. Application to section 5703 is based on former section 73b–2, which is carried into section 5703.
Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.

Amendments1975—Pub. L. 94–22 struck out “or individual” after “employee” wherever appearing.
