(B) the period of repayment of principal will be lengthened or shortened,


in order to reflect adjustments in interest rates occurring as a consequence of section 1077a(c)(4) of this title.


(e) Refinancing(1) Refinancing to secure combined paymentAn eligible lender may at any time consolidate loans held by it which are made under this section to a borrower, including loans which were made under this section as in effect prior to October 17, 1986, under a single repayment schedule which provides for a single principal payment and a single payment of interest, and shall calculate the repayment period for each included loan from the date of the commencement of repayment of the most recent included loan. Unless the consolidated loan is obtained by a borrower who is electing to obtain variable interest under paragraph (2) or (3), such consolidated loan shall bear interest at the weighted average of the rates of all included loans. The extension of any repayment period of an included loan pursuant to this paragraph shall be reported (if required by them) to the Secretary or guaranty agency insuring the loan, as the case may be, but no additional insurance premiums shall be payable with respect to any such extension. The extension of the repayment period of any included loan shall not require the formal extension of the promissory note evidencing the included loan or the execution of a new promissory note, but shall be treated as an administrative forbearance of the repayment terms of the included loan.


(2) Refinancing to secure variable interest rateAn eligible lender may reissue a loan which was made under this section before July 1, 1987, or under this section as in effect prior to October 17, 1986, in order to permit the borrower to obtain the interest rate provided under section 1077a(c)(4) of this title. A lender offering to reissue a loan or loans for such purpose may charge a borrower an amount not to exceed $100 to cover the administrative costs of reissuing such loan or loans, not more than one-half of which shall be paid to the guarantor of the loan being reissued to cover costs of reissuance. Reissuance of a loan under this paragraph shall not affect any insurance applicable with respect to the loan, and no additional insurance fee may be charged to the borrower with respect to the loan.


(3) Refinancing by discharge of previous loanA borrower who has applied to an original lender for reissuance of a loan under paragraph (2) and who is denied such reissuance may obtain a loan from another lender for the purpose of discharging the loan from such original lender. A loan made for such purpose—(A) shall bear interest at the applicable rate of interest provided under section 1077a(c)(4) of this title;

(B) shall not result in the extension of the duration of the note (other than as permitted under subsection (d)(5)(B) of this section);

(C) may be subject to an additional insurance fee but shall not be subject to the administrative cost charge permitted by paragraph (2) of this subsection; and

(D) shall be applied to discharge the borrower from any remaining obligation to the original lender with respect to the original loan.


(4) Certification in lieu of promissory note presentationEach new lender may accept certification from the original lender of the borrower’s original loan in lieu of presentation of the original promissory note.



(f) Verification of immigration status and social security numberA parent who wishes to borrow funds under this section shall be subject to verification of the parent’s—(1) immigration status in the same manner as immigration status is verified for students under section 1091(g) of this title; and

(2) social security number in the same manner as social security numbers are verified for students under section 1091(p) of this title.
