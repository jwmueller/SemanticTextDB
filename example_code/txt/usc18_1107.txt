§ 3289. Indictments and information dismissed before period of limitations
Whenever an indictment or information charging a felony is dismissed for any reason before the period prescribed by the applicable statute of limitations has expired, and such period will expire within six calendar months of the date of the dismissal of the indictment or information, a new indictment may be returned in the appropriate jurisdiction within six calendar months of the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, or, in the event of an appeal, within 60 days of the date the dismissal of the indictment or information becomes final, or, if no regular grand jury is in session in the appropriate jurisdiction at the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, within six calendar months of the date when the next regular grand jury is convened, which new indictment shall not be barred by any statute of limitations. This section does not permit the filing of a new indictment or information where the reason for the dismissal was the failure to file the indictment or information within the period prescribed by the applicable statute of limitations, or some other reason that would bar a new prosecution.

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 556a, 588, 589 (Apr. 30, 1934, ch. 170, § 1, 48 Stat. 648; May 10, 1934, ch. 278, §§ 2, 3, 48 Stat. 772).
Consolidation of sections 556a, 588, and 589 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., without change of substance. The provisions of said section 556a, with reference to time of filing motion, were omitted and numerous changes of phraseology were necessary to effect consolidation, particularly in view of rules 6(b) and 12(b)(2), (3), (5) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
Words “regular or special” were omitted and “regular” inserted after “succeeding” to harmonize with section 3288 of this title.
