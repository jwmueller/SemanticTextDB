Revised sectionSource (U.S. Code)Source (Statutes at Large)


230241:158 (less clause (b)).Feb. 19, 1948, ch. 65, § 9 (less clause (b)), 62 Stat. 24.


In clause (1), the words “(if any)” are omitted as surplusage. The words “Secretary of the Treasury” are substituted for the words “Commandant, United States Coast Guard, Treasury Department”, since the functions of the Coast Guard and its officers, while operating under the Department of the Treasury, were vested in the Secretary of the Treasury by 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 26, effective July 31, 1950, 64 Stat. 1280. Under that plan the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to delegate any of those functions to the agencies and employees of the Department of the Treasury.
Clauses (2) and (3) are inserted for clarity, and are based on the usage of those terms throughout the revised chapter.
