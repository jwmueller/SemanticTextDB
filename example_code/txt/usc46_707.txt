In paragraph (1)(A), the words “a documented vessel with a registry or coastwise endorsement under chapter 121 of this title” are substituted for “any vessel registered, enrolled, or licensed under the laws of the United States” because of 46 U.S.C. 12101(b).
In paragraph (1)(B). the words “or any department or agency thereof” are omitted as surplus.
In paragraph (1)(C), the word “fisheries” is substituted for “fishing trade or industry” because of the definition of “fisheries” in chapter 1 of the revised title.
