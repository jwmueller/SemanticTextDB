§ 1395ss. Certification of medicare supplemental health insurance policies(a) Submission of policy by insurer(1) The Secretary shall establish a procedure whereby medicare supplemental policies (as defined in subsection (g)(1) of this section) may be certified by the Secretary as meeting minimum standards and requirements set forth in subsection (c) of this section. Such procedure shall provide an opportunity for any insurer to submit any such policy, and such additional data as the Secretary finds necessary, to the Secretary for his examination and for his certification thereof as meeting the standards and requirements set forth in subsection (c) of this section. Subject to subsections (k)(3), (m), and (n) of this section, such certification shall remain in effect if the insurer files a notarized statement with the Secretary no later than June 30 of each year stating that the policy continues to meet such standards and requirements and if the insurer submits such additional data as the Secretary finds necessary to independently verify the accuracy of such notarized statement. Where the Secretary determines such a policy meets (or continues to meet) such standards and requirements, he shall authorize the insurer to have printed on such policy (but only in accordance with such requirements and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe) an emblem which the Secretary shall cause to be designed for use as an indication that a policy has received the Secretary’s certification. The Secretary shall provide each State commissioner or superintendent of insurance with a list of all the policies which have received his certification.

(2) No medicare supplemental policy may be issued in a State on or after the date specified in subsection (p)(1)(C) of this section unless—(A) the State’s regulatory program under subsection (b)(1) of this section provides for the application and enforcement of the standards and requirements set forth in such subsection (including the 1991 NAIC Model Regulation or 1991 Federal Regulation (as the case may be)) by the date specified in subsection (p)(1)(C) of this section; or

(B) if the State’s program does not provide for the application and enforcement of such standards and requirements, the policy has been certified by the Secretary under paragraph (1) as meeting the standards and requirements set forth in subsection (c) of this section (including such applicable standards) by such date.


Any person who issues a medicare supplemental policy, on and after the effective date specified in subsection (p)(1)(C) of this section, in violation of this paragraph is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $25,000 for each such violation. The provisions of section 1320a–7a of this title (other than the first sentence of subsection (a) and other than subsection (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a–7a(a) of this title.


(b) Standards and requirements; periodic review by Secretary(1) Any medicare supplemental policy issued in any State which the Secretary determines has established under State law a regulatory program that—(A) provides for the application and enforcement of standards with respect to such policies equal to or more stringent than the NAIC Model Standards (as defined in subsection (g)(2)(A) of this section), except as otherwise provided by subparagraph (H);

(B) includes requirements equal to or more stringent than the requirements described in paragraphs (2) through (5) of subsection (c) of this section;

(C) provides that—(i) information with respect to the actual ratio of benefits provided to premiums collected under such policies will be reported to the State on forms conforming to those developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for such purpose, or

(ii) such ratios will be monitored under the program in an alternative manner approved by the Secretary, and that a copy of each such policy, the most recent premium for each such policy, and a listing of the ratio of benefits provided to premiums collected for the most recent 3-year period for each such policy issued or sold in the State is maintained and made available to interested persons;


(D) provides for application and enforcement of the standards and requirements described in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) to all medicare supplemental policies (as defined in subsection (g)(1) of this section) issued in such State,

(E) provides the Secretary periodically (but at least annually) with a list containing the name and address of the issuer of each such policy and the name and number of each such policy (including an indication of policies that have been previously approved, newly approved, or withdrawn from approval since the previous list was provided),

(F) reports to the Secretary on the implementation and enforcement of standards and requirements of this paragraph at intervals established by the Secretary,

(G) provides for a process for approving or disapproving proposed premium increases with respect to such policies, and establishes a policy for the holding of public hearings prior to approval of a premium increase, and

(H) in the case of a policy that meets the standards under subparagraph (A) except that benefits under the policy are limited to items and services furnished by certain entities (or reduced benefits are provided when items or services are furnished by other entities), provides for the application of requirements equal to or more stringent than the requirements under subsection (t) of this section,


shall be deemed (subject to subsections (k)(3), (m), and (n) of this section, for so long as the Secretary finds that such State regulatory program continues to meet the standards and requirements of this paragraph) to meet the standards and requirements set forth in subsection (c) of this section. Each report required under subparagraph (F) shall include information on loss ratios of policies sold in the State, frequency and types of instances in which policies approved by the State fail to meet the standards and requirements of this paragraph, actions taken by the State to bring such policies into compliance, information regarding State programs implementing consumer protection provisions, and such further information as the Secretary in consultation with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners may specify.

(2) The Secretary periodically shall review State regulatory programs to determine if they continue to meet the standards and requirements specified in paragraph (1). If the Secretary finds that a State regulatory program no longer meets the standards and requirements, before making a final determination, the Secretary shall provide the State an opportunity to adopt such a plan of correction as would permit the State regulatory program to continue to meet such standards and requirements. If the Secretary makes a final determination that the State regulatory program, after such an opportunity, fails to meet such standards and requirements, the program shall no longer be considered to have in operation a program meeting such standards and requirements.

(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a medicare supplemental policy offered in a State shall not be deemed to meet the standards and requirements set forth in subsection (c) of this section, with respect to an advertisement (whether through written, radio, or television medium) used (or, at a State’s option, to be used) for the policy in the State, unless the entity issuing the policy provides a copy of each advertisement to the Commissioner of Insurance (or comparable officer identified by the Secretary) of that State for review or approval to the extent it may be required under State law.


(c) Requisite findingsThe Secretary shall certify under this section any medicare supplemental policy, or continue certification of such a policy, only if he finds that such policy (or, with respect to paragraph (3) or the requirement described in subsection (s) of this section, the issuer of the policy)—(1) meets or exceeds (either in a single policy or, in the case of nonprofit hospital and medical service associations, in one or more policies issued in conjunction with one another) the NAIC Model Standards (except as otherwise provided by subsection (t) of this section);

(2) meets the requirements of subsection (r) of this section;

(3)(A) accepts a notice under section 1395u(h)(3)(B) of this title as a claim form for benefits under such policy in lieu of any claim form otherwise required and agrees to make a payment determination on the basis of the information contained in such notice;

(B) where such a notice is received—(i) provides notice to such physician or supplier and the beneficiary of the payment determination under the policy, and

(ii) provides any payment covered by such policy directly to the participating physician or supplier involved;


(C) provides each enrollee at the time of enrollment a card listing the policy name and number and a single mailing address to which notices under section 1395u(h)(3)(B) of this title respecting the policy are to be sent;

(D) agrees to pay any user fees established under section 1395u(h)(3)(B) of this title with respect to information transmitted to the issuer of the policy; and

(E) provides to the Secretary at least annually, for transmittal to carriers, a single mailing address to which notices under section 1395u(h)(3)(B) of this title respecting the policy are to be sent;


(4) may, during a period of not less than 30 days after the policy is issued, be returned for a full refund of any premiums paid (without regard to the manner in which the purchase of the policy was solicited); and

(5) meets the applicable requirements of subsections (o) through (t) of this section.


(d) Criminal penalties; civil penalties for certain violations(1) Whoever knowingly and willfully makes or causes to be made or induces or seeks to induce the making of any false statement or representation of a material fact with respect to the compliance of any policy with the standards and requirements set forth in subsection (c) of this section or in regulations promulgated pursuant to such subsection, or with respect to the use of the emblem designed by the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section, shall be fined under title 18 or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both, and, in addition to or in lieu of such a criminal penalty, is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $5,000 for each such prohibited act.

(2) Whoever falsely assumes or pretends to be acting, or misrepresents in any way that he is acting, under the authority of or in association with, the program of health insurance established by this subchapter, or any Federal agency, for the purpose of selling or attempting to sell insurance, or in such pretended character demands, or obtains money, paper, documents, or anything of value, shall be fined under title 18 or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both, and, in addition to or in lieu of such a criminal penalty, is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $5,000 for each such prohibited act.

(3)(A)(i) It is unlawful for a person to sell or issue to an individual entitled to benefits under part A of this subchapter or enrolled under part B of this subchapter (including an individual electing a Medicare+Choice plan under section 1395w–21 of this title)—(I) a health insurance policy with knowledge that the policy duplicates health benefits to which the individual is otherwise entitled under this subchapter or subchapter XIX of this chapter,

(II) in the case of an individual not electing a Medicare+Choice plan, a medicare supplemental policy with knowledge that the individual is entitled to benefits under another medicare supplemental policy or in the case of an individual electing a Medicare+Choice plan, a medicare supplemental policy with knowledge that the policy duplicates health benefits to which the individual is otherwise entitled under the Medicare+Choice plan or under another medicare supplemental policy, or

(III) a health insurance policy (other than a medicare supplemental policy) with knowledge that the policy duplicates health benefits to which the individual is otherwise entitled, other than benefits to which the individual is entitled under a requirement of State or Federal law.


(ii) Whoever violates clause (i) shall be fined under title 18 or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both, and, in addition to or in lieu of such a criminal penalty, is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $25,000 (or $15,000 in the case of a person other than the issuer of the policy) for each such prohibited act.

(iii) A seller (who is not the issuer of a health insurance policy) shall not be considered to violate clause (i)(II) with respect to the sale of a medicare supplemental policy if the policy is sold in compliance with subparagraph (B).

(iv) For purposes of this subparagraph, a health insurance policy (other than a Medicare supplemental policy) providing for benefits which are payable to or on behalf of an individual without regard to other health benefit coverage of such individual is not considered to “duplicate” any health benefits under this subchapter, under subchapter XIX of this chapter, or under a health insurance policy, and subclauses (I) and (III) of clause (i) do not apply to such a policy.

(v) For purposes of this subparagraph, a health insurance policy (or a rider to an insurance contract which is not a health insurance policy) is not considered to “duplicate” health benefits under this subchapter or under another health insurance policy if it—(I) provides health care benefits only for long-term care, nursing home care, home health care, or community-based care, or any combination thereof,

(II) coordinates against or excludes items and services available or paid for under this subchapter or under another health insurance policy, and

(III) for policies sold or issued on or after the end of the 90-day period beginning on August 21, 1996, discloses such coordination or exclusion in the policy’s outline of coverage.


For purposes of this clause, the terms “coordinates” and “coordination” mean, with respect to a policy in relation to health benefits under this subchapter or under another health insurance policy, that the policy under its terms is secondary to, or excludes from payment, items and services to the extent available or paid for under this subchapter or under another health insurance policy.

(vi)(I) An individual entitled to benefits under part A of this subchapter or enrolled under part B of this subchapter who is applying for a health insurance policy (other than a policy described in subclause (III)) shall be furnished a disclosure statement described in clause (vii) for the type of policy being applied for. Such statement shall be furnished as a part of (or together with) the application for such policy.

(II) Whoever issues or sells a health insurance policy (other than a policy described in subclause (III)) to an individual described in subclause (I) and fails to furnish the appropriate disclosure statement as required under such subclause shall be fined under title 18, or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both, and, in addition to or in lieu of such a criminal penalty, is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $25,000 (or $15,000 in the case of a person other than the issuer of the policy) for each such violation.

(III) A policy described in this subclause (to which subclauses (I) and (II) do not apply) is a Medicare supplemental policy, a policy described in clause (v), or a health insurance policy identified under 60 Federal Register 30880 (June 12, 1995) as a policy not required to have a disclosure statement.

(IV) Any reference in this section to the revised NAIC model regulation (referred to in subsection (m)(1)(A) of this section) is deemed a reference to such regulation as revised by section 171(m)(2) of the Social Security Act Amendments of 1994 (Public Law 103–432) and as modified by substituting, for the disclosure required under section 16D(2), disclosure under subclause (I) of an appropriate disclosure statement under clause (vii).


(vii) The disclosure statement described in this clause for a type of policy is the statement specified under subparagraph (D) of this paragraph (as in effect before August 21, 1996) for that type of policy, as revised as follows:(I) In each statement, amend the second line to read as follows:“THIS IS NOT MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT



INSURANCE”.
(II) In each statement, strike the third line and insert the following: “Some health care services paid for by Medicare may also trigger the payment of benefits under this policy.”.

(III) In each statement not described in subclause (V), strike the boldface matter that begins “This insurance” and all that follows up to the next paragraph that begins “Medicare”.

(IV) In each statement not described in subclause (V), insert before the boxed matter (that states “Before You Buy This Insurance”) the following: “This policy must pay benefits without regard to other health benefit coverage to which you may be entitled under Medicare or other insurance.”.

(V) In a statement relating to policies providing both nursing home and non-institutional coverage, to policies providing nursing home benefits only, or policies providing home care benefits only, amend the sentence that begins “Federal law” to read as follows: “Federal law requires us to inform you that in certain situations this insurance may pay for some care also covered by Medicare.”.


(viii)(I) Subject to subclause (II), nothing in this subparagraph shall restrict or preclude a State’s ability to regulate health insurance policies, including any health insurance policy that is described in clause (iv), (v), or (vi)(III).

(II) A State may not declare or specify, in statute, regulation, or otherwise, that a health insurance policy (other than a Medicare supplemental policy) or rider to an insurance contract which is not a health insurance policy, that is described in clause (iv), (v), or (vi)(III) and that is sold, issued, or renewed to an individual entitled to benefits under part A of this subchapter or enrolled under part B of this subchapter “duplicates” health benefits under this subchapter or under a Medicare supplemental policy.



(B)(i) It is unlawful for a person to issue or sell a medicare supplemental policy to an individual entitled to benefits under part A of this subchapter or enrolled under part B of this subchapter, whether directly, through the mail, or otherwise, unless—(I) the person obtains from the individual, as part of the application for the issuance or purchase and on a form described in clause (ii), a written statement signed by the individual stating, to the best of the individual’s knowledge, what health insurance policies (including any Medicare+Choice plan) the individual has, from what source, and whether the individual is entitled to any medical assistance under subchapter XIX of this chapter, whether as a qualified medicare beneficiary or otherwise, and

(II) the written statement is accompanied by a written acknowledgment, signed by the seller of the policy, of the request for and receipt of such statement.


(ii) The statement required by clause (i) shall be made on a form that—(I) states in substance that a medicare-eligible individual does not need more than one medicare supplemental policy,

(II) states in substance that individuals may be eligible for benefits under the State medicaid program under subchapter XIX of this chapter and that such individuals who are entitled to benefits under that program usually do not need a medicare supplemental policy and that benefits and premiums under any such policy shall be suspended upon request of the policyholder during the period (of not longer than 24 months) of entitlement to benefits under such subchapter and may be reinstituted upon loss of such entitlement, and

(III) states that counseling services may be available in the State to provide advice concerning the purchase of medicare supplemental policies and enrollment under the medicaid program and may provide the telephone number for such services.


(iii)(I) Except as provided in subclauses (II) and (III), if the statement required by clause (i) is not obtained or indicates that the individual has a medicare supplemental policy or indicates that the individual is entitled to any medical assistance under subchapter XIX of this chapter, the sale of a medicare supplemental policy shall be considered to be a violation of subparagraph (A).

(II) Subclause (I) shall not apply in the case of an individual who has a medicare supplemental policy, if the individual indicates in writing, as part of the application for purchase, that the policy being purchased replaces such other policy and indicates an intent to terminate the policy being replaced when the new policy becomes effective and the issuer or seller certifies in writing that such policy will not, to the best of the issuer’s or seller’s knowledge, duplicate coverage (taking into account any such replacement).

(III) If the statement required by clause (i) is obtained and indicates that the individual is entitled to any medical assistance under subchapter XIX of this chapter, the sale of the policy is not in violation of clause (i) (insofar as such clause relates to such medical assistance), if (aa) a State medicaid plan under such subchapter pays the premiums for the policy, (bb) in the case of a qualified medicare beneficiary described in section 1396d(p)(1) of this title, the policy provides for coverage of outpatient prescription drugs, or (cc) the only medical assistance to which the individual is entitled under the State plan is medicare cost sharing described in section 1396d(p)(3)(A)(ii) of this title.


(iv) Whoever issues or sells a medicare supplemental policy in violation of this subparagraph shall be fined under title 18, or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both, and, in addition to or in lieu of such a criminal penalty, is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $25,000 (or $15,000 in the case of a seller who is not the issuer of a policy) for each such violation.


(C) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply with respect to the sale or issuance of a group policy or plan of one or more employers or labor organizations, or of the trustees of a fund established by one or more employers or labor organizations (or combination thereof), for employees or former employees (or combination thereof) or for members or former members (or combination thereof) of the labor organizations.


(4)(A) Whoever knowingly, directly or through his agent, mails or causes to be mailed any matter for a prohibited purpose (as determined under subparagraph (B)) shall be fined under title 18 or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both, and, in addition to or in lieu of such a criminal penalty, is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $5,000 for each such prohibited act.

(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), a prohibited purpose means the advertising, solicitation, or offer for sale of a medicare supplemental policy, or the delivery of such a policy, in or into any State in which such policy has not been approved by the State commissioner or superintendent of insurance.

(C) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply in the case of a person who mails or causes to be mailed a medicare supplemental policy into a State if such person has ascertained that the party insured under such policy to whom (or on whose behalf) such policy is mailed is located in such State on a temporary basis.

(D) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply in the case of a person who mails or causes to be mailed a duplicate copy of a medicare supplemental policy previously issued to the party to whom (or on whose behalf) such duplicate copy is mailed.

(5) The provisions of section 1320a–7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to civil money penalties under paragraphs (1), (2), (3)(A), and (4)(A) in the same manner as such provisions apply to penalties and proceedings under section 1320a–7a(a) of this title.


(e) Dissemination of information(1) The Secretary shall provide to all individuals entitled to benefits under this subchapter (and, to the extent feasible, to individuals about to become so entitled) such information as will permit such individuals to evaluate the value of medicare supplemental policies to them and the relationship of any such policies to benefits provided under this subchapter.

(2) The Secretary shall—(A) inform all individuals entitled to benefits under this subchapter (and, to the extent feasible, individuals about to become so entitled) of—(i) the actions and practices that are subject to sanctions under subsection (d) of this section, and

(B) publish the toll-free telephone number for individuals to report suspected violations of the provisions of such subsection.


(3) The Secretary shall provide individuals entitled to benefits under this subchapter (and, to the extent feasible, individuals about to become so entitled) with a listing of the addresses and telephone numbers of State and Federal agencies and offices that provide information and assistance to individuals with respect to the selection of medicare supplemental policies.


(f) Study and evaluation of comparative effectiveness of various State approaches to regulating medicare supplemental policies; report to Congress no later than January 1, 1982; periodic evaluations(1)(A) The Secretary shall, in consultation with Federal and State regulatory agencies, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, private insurers, and organizations representing consumers and the aged, conduct a comprehensive study and evaluation of the comparative effectiveness of various State approaches to the regulation of medicare supplemental policies in (i) limiting marketing and agent abuse, (ii) assuring the dissemination of such information to individuals entitled to benefits under this subchapter (and to other consumers) as is necessary to permit informed choice, (iii) promoting policies which provide reasonable economic benefits for such individuals, (iv) reducing the purchase of unnecessary duplicative coverage, (v) improving price competition, and (vi) establishing effective approved State regulatory programs described in subsection (b) of this section.

(B) Such study shall also address the need for standards or certification of health insurance policies, other than medicare supplemental policies, sold to individuals eligible for benefits under this subchapter.

(C) The Secretary shall, no later than January 1, 1982, submit a report to the Congress on the results of such study and evaluation, accompanied by such recommendations as the Secretary finds warranted by such results with respect to the need for legislative or administrative changes to accomplish the objectives set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (B), including the need for a mandatory Federal regulatory program to assure the marketing of appropriate types of medicare supplemental policies, and such other means as he finds may be appropriate to enhance effective State regulation of such policies.


(2) The Secretary shall submit to the Congress no later than July 1, 1982, and periodically as may be appropriate thereafter (but not less often than once every 2 years), a report evaluating the effectiveness of the certification procedure and the criminal penalties established under this section, and shall include in such reports an analysis of—(A) the impact of such procedure and penalties on the types, market share, value, and cost to individuals entitled to benefits under this subchapter of medicare supplemental policies which have been certified by the Secretary;

(B) the need for any change in the certification procedure to improve its administration or effectiveness; and

(C) whether the certification program and criminal penalties should be continued.


(3) The Secretary shall provide information via a toll-free telephone number on medicare supplemental policies (including the relationship of State programs under subchapter XIX of this chapter to such policies).


(g) Definitions(1) For purposes of this section, a medicare supplemental policy is a health insurance policy or other health benefit plan offered by a private entity to individuals who are entitled to have payment made under this subchapter, which provides reimbursement for expenses incurred for services and items for which payment may be made under this subchapter but which are not reimbursable by reason of the applicability of deductibles, coinsurance amounts, or other limitations imposed pursuant to this subchapter; but does not include a prescription drug plan under part D of this subchapter or a Medicare+Choice plan or any such policy or plan of one or more employers or labor organizations, or of the trustees of a fund established by one or more employers or labor organizations (or combination thereof), for employees or former employees (or combination thereof) or for members or former members (or combination thereof) of the labor organizations and does not include a policy or plan of an eligible organization (as defined in section 1395mm(b) of this title) if the policy or plan provides benefits pursuant to a contract under section 1395mm of this title or an approved demonstration project described in section 603(c) of the Social Security Amendments of 1983, section 2355 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, or section 9412(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, or a policy or plan of an organization if the policy or plan provides benefits pursuant to an agreement under section 1395l(a)(1)(A) of this title. For purposes of this section, the term “policy” includes a certificate issued under such policy.

(2) For purposes of this section:(A) The term “NAIC Model Standards” means the “NAIC Model Regulation to Implement the Individual Accident and Sickness Insurance Minimum Standards Act”, adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners on June 6, 1979, as it applies to medicare supplemental policies.

(2)(A) The Secretary shall not implement the certification program established under subsection (a) of this section with respect to policies issued in a State unless the Panel makes a finding that such State cannot be expected to have established, by July 1, 1982, an approved State regulatory program meeting the standards and requirements of subsection (b)(1) of this section. If the Panel makes such a finding, the Secretary shall implement such program under subsection (a) of this section with respect to medicare supplemental policies issued in such State, until such time as the Panel determines that such State has a program that meets the standards and requirements of subsection (b)(1) of this section.

(B) The date specified in this subparagraph for a State is the earlier of the date the State adopts standards equal to or more stringent than the Federal model standards or 1 year after the date the Secretary first promulgates such standards.


(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section (except as provided in subsections (l), (m), and (n) of this section)—(A) no medicare supplemental policy may be certified by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (a) of this section,

(B) no certification made pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall remain in effect, and

(C) no State regulatory program shall be found to meet (or to continue to meet) the requirements of subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section,


unless such policy meets (or such program provides for the application of standards equal to or more stringent than) the standards set forth in the amended NAIC Model Regulation or the Federal model standards (as the case may be) by the date specified in paragraph (1)(B) or (2)(B) (as the case may be).


(l) Transitional compliance with NAIC Model Transition Regulation; “qualifying medicare supplemental policy” and “NAIC Model Transition Regulation” defined(1) Until the date specified in paragraph (3), in the case of a qualifying medicare supplemental policy described in paragraph (2) issued—(A) before January 1, 1989, the policy is deemed to remain in compliance with this section if the insurer issuing the policy complies with the NAIC Model Transition Regulation (including giving notices to subscribers and filing for premium adjustments with the State as described in section 5.B. of such Regulation) by January 1, 1989; or

(B) on or after January 1, 1989, the policy is deemed to be in compliance with this section if the insurer issuing the policy complies with the NAIC Model Transition Regulation before the date of the sale of the policy.

(ii) having a legislature which is not scheduled to meet in 1989 in a legislative session in which such legislation may be considered,


the date specified in this subparagraph is the first day of the first calendar quarter beginning after the close of the first legislative session of the State legislature that begins on or after January 1, 1989, and in which legislation described in clause (i) may be considered.

(B) does not have in effect standards equal to or more stringent than the NAIC Model Transition Regulation (or otherwise requiring notice substantially the same as the notice required in section 5.B. of such Regulation),


the policy shall not be deemed to meet the standards in subsection (c) of this section unless each individual who is entitled to benefits under this subchapter and is a policyholder under such policy on January 1, 1989, is sent such a notice in any appropriate form by not later than January 31, 1989, that explains—
(A) the improved benefits under this subchapter contained in the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, and

(B) how these improvements affect the benefits contained in the policies and the premium for the policy.


(5) In this subsection, the term “NAIC Model Transition Regulation” refers to the standards contained in the “Model Regulation to Implement Transitional Requirements for the Conversion of Medicare Supplement Insurance Benefits and Premiums to Conform to Medicare Program Revisions” (as adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in September 1987).


(m) Revision of amended NAIC Model Regulation and amended Federal model standards; effective dates; medicare supplemental policy and State regulatory program meeting applicable standards(1)(A) If, within the 90-day period beginning on December 13, 1989, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (in this subsection and subsection (n) of this section referred to as the “Association”) revises the amended NAIC Model Regulation (referred to in subsection (k)(1)(A) of this section and adopted on September 20, 1988) to improve such regulation and otherwise to reflect the changes in law made by the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Repeal Act of 1989, subsection (g)(2)(A) of this section shall be applied in a State, effective on and after the date specified in subparagraph (B), as if the reference to the Model Regulation adopted on June 6, 1979, were a reference to the amended NAIC Model Regulation (referred to in subsection (k)(1)(A) of this section) as revised by the Association in accordance with this paragraph (in this subsection and subsection (n) of this section referred to as the “revised NAIC Model Regulation”).

(B) The date specified in this subparagraph for a State is the earlier of the date the State adopts standards equal to or more stringent than the revised NAIC Model Regulation or 1 year after the date the Association first adopts such revised Regulation.


(2)(A) If the Association does not revise the amended NAIC Model Regulation, within the 90-day period specified in paragraph (1)(A), the Secretary shall promulgate, not later than 60 days after the end of such period, revised Federal model standards (in this subsection and subsection (n) of this section referred to as “revised Federal model standards”) for medicare supplemental policies to improve such standards and otherwise to reflect the changes in law made by the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Repeal Act of 1989, subsection (g)(2)(A) of this section shall be applied in a State, effective on and after the date specified in subparagraph (B), as if the reference to the Model Regulation adopted on June 6, 1979, were a reference to the revised Federal model standards.

(B) The date specified in this subparagraph for a State is the earlier of the date the State adopts standards equal to or more stringent than the revised Federal model standards or 1 year after the date the Secretary first promulgates such standards.


(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section (except as provided in subsection (n) of this section)—(A) no medicare supplemental policy may be certified by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (a) of this section,

(B) no certification made pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall remain in effect, and

(C) no State regulatory program shall be found to meet (or to continue to meet) the requirements of subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section,


unless such policy meets (or such program provides for the application of standards equal to or more stringent than) the standards set forth in the revised NAIC Model Regulation or the revised Federal model standards (as the case may be) by the date specified in paragraph (1)(B) or (2)(B) (as the case may be).


(n) Transition compliance with revision of NAIC Model Regulation and Federal model standards(1) Until the date specified in paragraph (4), in the case of a qualifying medicare supplemental policy described in paragraph (3) issued in a State—(A) before the transition deadline, the policy is deemed to remain in compliance with the standards described in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section only if the insurer issuing the policy complies with the transition provision described in paragraph (2), or

(B) on or after the transition deadline, the policy is deemed to be in compliance with the standards described in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section only if the insurer issuing the policy complies with the revised NAIC Model Regulation or the revised Federal model standards (as the case may be) before the date of the sale of the policy.


In this paragraph, the term “transition deadline” means 1 year after the date the Association adopts the revised NAIC Model Regulation or 1 year after the date the Secretary promulgates revised Federal model standards (as the case may be).

(2) The transition provision described in this paragraph is—(A) such transition provision as the Association provides, by not later than December 15, 1989, so as to provide for an appropriate transition (i) to restore benefit provisions which are no longer duplicative as a result of the changes in benefits under this subchapter made by the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Repeal Act of 1989 and (ii) to eliminate the requirement of payment for the first 8 days of coinsurance for extended care services, or

(B) if the Association does not provide for a transition provision by the date described in subparagraph (A), such transition provision as the Secretary shall provide, by January 1, 1990, so as to provide for an appropriate transition described in subparagraph (A).


(3) In paragraph (1), the term “qualifying medicare supplemental policy” means a medicare supplemental policy which has been issued in compliance with this section as in effect on the date before December 13, 1989.

(4)(A) The date specified in this paragraph for a policy issued in a State is—(i) the first date a State adopts, after December 13, 1989, standards equal to or more stringent than the revised NAIC Model Regulation (or revised Federal model standards), as the case may be, or

whichever is earlier.

(B) In the case of a State which the Secretary identifies, in consultation with the Association, as—(i) requiring State legislation (other than legislation appropriating funds) in order for medicare supplemental policies to meet standards described in subparagraph (A)(i), but

(ii) having a legislature which is not scheduled to meet in 1990 in a legislative session in which such legislation may be considered,


the date specified in this subparagraph is the first day of the first calendar quarter beginning after the close of the first legislative session of the State legislature that begins on or after January 1, 1990. For purposes of the previous sentence, in the case of a State that has a 2-year legislative session, each year of such session shall be deemed to be a separate regular session of the State legislature.


(5) In the case of a medicare supplemental policy in effect on January 1, 1990, the policy shall not be deemed to meet the standards in subsection (c) of this section unless each individual who is entitled to benefits under this subchapter and is a policyholder or certificate holder under such policy on such date is sent a notice in an appropriate form by not later than January 31, 1990, that explains—(A) the changes in benefits under this subchapter effected by the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Repeal Act of 1989, and

(B) how these changes may affect the benefits contained in such policy and the premium for the policy.


(6)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), in the case of an individual who had in effect, as of December 31, 1988, a medicare supplemental policy with an insurer (as a policyholder or, in the case of a group policy, as a certificate holder) and the individual terminated coverage under such policy before December 13, 1989, no medicare supplemental policy of the insurer shall be deemed to meet the standards in subsection (c) of this section unless the insurer—(i) provides written notice, no earlier than December 15, 1989, and no later than January 30, 1990, to the policyholder or certificate holder (at the most recent available address) of the offer described in clause (ii), and

(ii) offers the individual, during a period of at least 60 days beginning not later than February 1, 1990, reinstitution of coverage (with coverage effective as of January 1, 1990), under the terms which (I) do not provide for any waiting period with respect to treatment of pre-existing conditions, (II) provides for coverage which is substantially equivalent to coverage in effect before the date of such termination, and (III) provides for classification of premiums on which terms are at least as favorable to the policyholder or certificate holder as the premium classification terms that would have applied to the policyholder or certificate holder had the coverage never terminated.


(B) An insurer is not required to make the offer under subparagraph (A)(ii) in the case of an individual who is a policyholder or certificate holder in another medicare supplemental policy as of December 13, 1989, if (as of January 1, 1990) the individual is not subject to a waiting period with respect to treatment of a pre-existing condition under such other policy.



(o) Requirements of group benefits; core group benefits; uniform outline of coverageThe requirements of this subsection are as follows:(1) Each medicare supplemental policy shall provide for coverage of a group of benefits consistent with subsections (p), (v) 11 So in original. Probably should be followed by a comma. (w), and (y) of this section.

(2) If the medicare supplemental policy provides for coverage of a group of benefits other than the core group of basic benefits described in subsection (p)(2)(B) of this section, the issuer of the policy must make available to the individual a medicare supplemental policy with only such core group of basic benefits.

(3) The issuer of the policy has provided, before the sale of the policy, an outline of coverage that uses uniform language and format (including layout and print size) that facilitates comparison among medicare supplemental policies and comparison with medicare benefits.

(4) The issuer of the medicare supplemental policy complies with subsection (s)(2)(E) and subsection (x).

(5) In addition to the requirement under paragraph (2), the issuer of the policy must make available to the individual at least Medicare supplemental policies with benefit packages classified as “C” or “F”.


(p) Standards for group benefits(1)(A) If, within 9 months after November 5, 1990, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (in this subsection referred to as the “Association”) changes the revised NAIC Model Regulation (described in subsection (m) of this section) to incorporate—(i) limitations on the groups or packages of benefits that may be offered under a medicare supplemental policy consistent with paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection,

(ii) uniform language and definitions to be used with respect to such benefits,

(iii) uniform format to be used in the policy with respect to such benefits, and

(iv) other standards to meet the additional requirements imposed by the amendments made by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990,


subsection (g)(2)(A) of this section shall be applied in each State, effective for policies issued to policyholders on and after the date specified in subparagraph (C), as if the reference to the Model Regulation adopted on June 6, 1979, were a reference to the revised NAIC Model Regulation as changed under this subparagraph (such changed regulation referred to in this section as the “1991 NAIC Model Regulation”).

(B) If the Association does not make the changes in the revised NAIC Model Regulation within the 9-month period specified in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall promulgate, not later than 9 months after the end of such period, a regulation and subsection (g)(2)(A) of this section shall be applied in each State, effective for policies issued to policyholders on and after the date specified in subparagraph (C), as if the reference to the Model Regulation adopted on June 6, 1979, were a reference to the revised NAIC Model Regulation as changed by the Secretary under this subparagraph (such changed regulation referred to in this section as the “1991 Federal Regulation”).

(C)(i) Subject to clause (ii), the date specified in this subparagraph for a State is the date the State adopts the 1991 NAIC Model Regulation or 1991 Federal Regulation or 1 year after the date the Association or the Secretary first adopts such standards, whichever is earlier.

(ii) In the case of a State which the Secretary identifies, in consultation with the Association, as—(I) requiring State legislation (other than legislation appropriating funds) in order for medicare supplemental policies to meet the 1991 NAIC Model Regulation or 1991 Federal Regulation, but

(II) having a legislature which is not scheduled to meet in 1992 in a legislative session in which such legislation may be considered,


the date specified in this subparagraph is the first day of the first calendar quarter beginning after the close of the first legislative session of the State legislature that begins on or after January 1, 1992. For purposes of the previous sentence, in the case of a State that has a 2-year legislative session, each year of such session shall be deemed to be a separate regular session of the State legislature.


(D) In promulgating standards under this paragraph, the Association or Secretary shall consult with a working group composed of representatives of issuers of medicare supplemental policies, consumer groups, medicare beneficiaries, and other qualified individuals. Such representatives shall be selected in a manner so as to assure balanced representation among the interested groups.

(E) If benefits (including deductibles and coinsurance) under this subchapter are changed and the Secretary determines, in consultation with the Association, that changes in the 1991 NAIC Model Regulation or 1991 Federal Regulation are needed to reflect such changes, the preceding provisions of this paragraph shall apply to the modification of standards previously established in the same manner as they applied to the original establishment of such standards.


(2) The benefits under the 1991 NAIC Model Regulation or 1991 Federal Regulation shall provide—(A) for such groups or packages of benefits as may be appropriate taking into account the considerations specified in paragraph (3) and the requirements of the succeeding subparagraphs;

(B) for identification of a core group of basic benefits common to all policies; and

(C) that, subject to paragraph (4)(B), the total number of different benefit packages (counting the core group of basic benefits described in subparagraph (B) and each other combination of benefits that may be offered as a separate benefit package) that may be established in all the States and by all issuers shall not exceed 10 plus the 2 plans described in paragraph (11)(A).


(3) The benefits under paragraph (2) shall, to the extent possible—(A) provide for benefits that offer consumers the ability to purchase the benefits that are available in the market as of November 5, 1990; and

(B) balance the objectives of (i) simplifying the market to facilitate comparisons among policies, (ii) avoiding adverse selection, (iii) providing consumer choice, (iv) providing market stability, and (v) promoting competition.


(4)(A)(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) or paragraph (6), no State with a regulatory program approved under subsection (b)(1) of this section may provide for or permit the grouping of benefits (or language or format with respect to such benefits) under a medicare supplemental policy unless such grouping meets the applicable 1991 NAIC Model Regulation or 1991 Federal Regulation.

(ii) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Secretary may not provide for or permit the grouping of benefits (or language or format with respect to such benefits) under a medicare supplemental policy seeking approval by the Secretary unless such grouping meets the applicable 1991 NAIC Model Regulation or 1991 Federal Regulation.


(B) With the approval of the State (in the case of a policy issued in a State with an approved regulatory program) or the Secretary (in the case of any other policy), the issuer of a medicare supplemental policy may offer new or innovative benefits in addition to the benefits provided in a policy that otherwise complies with the applicable 1991 NAIC Model Regulation or 1991 Federal Regulation. Any such new or innovative benefits may include benefits that are not otherwise available and are cost-effective and shall be offered in a manner which is consistent with the goal of simplification of medicare supplemental policies.


(5)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), this subsection shall not be construed as preventing a State from restricting the groups of benefits that may be offered in medicare supplemental policies in the State.

(B) A State with a regulatory program approved under subsection (b)(1) of this section may not restrict under subparagraph (A) the offering of a medicare supplemental policy consisting only of the core group of benefits described in paragraph (2)(B).


(6) The Secretary may waive the application of standards described in clauses (i) through (iii) of paragraph (1)(A) in those States that on November 5, 1990, had in place an alternative simplification program.

(7) This subsection shall not be construed as preventing an issuer of a medicare supplemental policy who otherwise meets the re­quirements of this section from providing, through an arrangement with a vendor, for discounts from that vendor to policyholders or certificateholders for the purchase of items or services not covered under its medicare supplemental policies.

(8) Any person who sells or issues a medicare supplemental policy, on and after the effective date specified in paragraph (1)(C) (but subject to paragraph (10)), in violation of the applicable 1991 NAIC Model Regulation or 1991 Federal Regulation insofar as such regulation relates to the requirements of subsection (o) or (q) of this section or clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of paragraph (1)(A) is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $25,000 (or $15,000 in the case of a seller who is not an issuer of a policy) for each such violation. The provisions of section 1320a–7a of this title (other than the first sentence of subsection (a) and other than subsection (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a–7a(a) of this title.

(9)(A) Anyone who sells a medicare supplemental policy to an individual shall make available for sale to the individual a medicare supplemental policy with only the core group of basic benefits (described in paragraph (2)(B)).

(B) Anyone who sells a medicare supplemental policy to an individual shall provide the individual, before the sale of the policy, an outline of coverage which describes the benefits under the policy. Such outline shall be on a standard form approved by the State regulatory program or the Secretary (as the case may be) consistent with the 1991 NAIC Model Regulation or 1991 Federal Regulation under this subsection.

(C) Whoever sells a medicare supplemental policy in violation of this paragraph is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $25,000 (or $15,000 in the case of a seller who is not the issuer of the policy) for each such violation. The provisions of section 1320a–7a of this title (other than the first sentence of subsection (a) and other than subsection (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a–7a(a) of this title.

(D) Subject to paragraph (10), this paragraph shall apply to sales of policies occurring on or after the effective date specified in paragraph (1)(C).


(10) No penalty may be imposed under paragraph (8) or (9) in the case of a seller who is not the issuer of a policy until the Secretary has published a list of the groups of benefit packages that may be sold or issued consistent with paragraph (1)(A)(i).

(11)(A) For purposes of paragraph (2), the benefit packages described in this subparagraph are as follows:(i) The benefit package classified as “F” under the standards established by such paragraph, except that it has a high deductible feature.

(ii) The benefit package classified as “J” under the standards established by such paragraph, except that it has a high deductible feature.


(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), a high deductible feature is one which—(i) requires the beneficiary of the policy to pay annual out-of-pocket expenses (other than premiums) in the amount specified in subparagraph (C) before the policy begins payment of benefits, and

(ii) covers 100 percent of covered out-of-pocket expenses once such deductible has been satisfied in a year.


(C) The amount specified in this subparagraph—(i) for 1998 and 1999 is $1,500, and

If any amount determined under clause (ii) is not a multiple of $10, it shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $10.



(q) Guaranteed renewal of policies; termination; suspensionThe requirements of this subsection are as follows:(1) Each medicare supplemental policy shall be guaranteed renewable and—(A) the issuer may not cancel or nonrenew the policy solely on the ground of health status of the individual; and

(B) the issuer shall not cancel or nonrenew the policy for any reason other than nonpayment of premium or material misrepresentation.


(2) If the medicare supplemental policy is terminated by the group policyholder and is not replaced as provided under paragraph (4), the issuer shall offer certificateholders an individual medicare supplemental policy which (at the option of the certificateholder)—(A) provides for continuation of the benefits contained in the group policy, or

(B) provides for such benefits as otherwise meets 22 So in original. Probably should be “meet”. the requirements of this section.


(3) If an individual is a certificateholder in a group medicare supplemental policy and the individual terminates membership in the group, the issuer shall—(A) offer the certificateholder the conversion opportunity described in paragraph (2), or

(B) at the option of the group policyholder, offer the certificateholder continuation of coverage under the group policy.


(4) If a group medicare supplemental policy is replaced by another group medicare supplemental policy purchased by the same policyholder, issuer 33 So in original. Probably should be preceded by “the”. of the replacement policy shall offer coverage to all persons covered under the old group policy on its date of termination. Coverage under the new group policy shall not result in any exclusion for preexisting conditions that would have been covered under the group policy being replaced.

(5)(A) Each medicare supplemental policy shall provide that benefits and premiums under the policy shall be suspended at the request of the policyholder for the period (not to exceed 24 months) in which the policyholder has applied for and is determined to be entitled to medical assistance under subchapter XIX of this chapter, but only if the policyholder notifies the issuer of such policy within 90 days after the date the individual becomes entitled to such assistance. If such suspension occurs and if the policyholder or certificate holder loses entitlement to such medical assistance, such policy shall be automatically reinstituted (effective as of the date of termination of such entitlement) under terms described in subsection (n)(6)(A)(ii) of this section as of the termination of such entitlement if the policyholder provides notice of loss of such entitlement within 90 days after the date of such loss.

(B) Nothing in this section shall be construed as affecting the authority of a State, under subchapter XIX of this chapter, to purchase a medicare supplemental policy for an individual otherwise entitled to assistance under such subchapter.

(C) Any person who issues a medicare supplemental policy and fails to comply with the requirements of this paragraph or paragraph (6) is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $25,000 for each such violation. The provisions of section 1320a–7a of this title (other than the first sentence of subsection (a) and other than subsection (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a–7a(a) of this title.


(6) Each medicare supplemental policy shall provide that benefits and premiums under the policy shall be suspended at the request of the policyholder if the policyholder is entitled to benefits under section 426(b) of this title and is covered under a group health plan (as defined in section 1395y(b)(1)(A)(v) of this title). If such suspension occurs and if the policyholder or certificate holder loses coverage under the group health plan, such policy shall be automatically reinstituted (effective as of the date of such loss of coverage) under terms described in subsection (n)(6)(A)(ii) of this section as of the loss of such coverage if the policyholder provides notice of loss of such coverage within 90 days after the date of such loss.


(r) Required ratio of aggregate benefits to aggregate premiums(1) A medicare supplemental policy may not be issued or renewed (or otherwise provide coverage after the date described in subsection (p)(1)(C) of this section) in any State unless—(A) the policy can be expected for periods after the effective date of these provisions (as estimated for the entire period for which rates are computed to provide coverage, on the basis of incurred claims experience and earned premiums for such periods and in accordance with a uniform methodology, including uniform reporting standards, developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners) to return to policyholders in the form of aggregate benefits provided under the policy, at least 75 percent of the aggregate amount of premiums collected in the case of group policies and at least 65 percent in the case of individual policies; and

(B) the issuer of the policy provides for the issuance of a proportional refund, or a credit against future premiums of a proportional amount, based on the premium paid and in accordance with paragraph (2), of the amount of premiums received necessary to assure that the ratio of aggregate benefits provided to the aggregate premiums collected (net of such refunds or credits) complies with the expectation required under subparagraph (A), treating policies of the same type as a single policy for each standard package.


For purposes of applying subparagraph (A) only, policies issued as a result of solicitations of individuals through the mails or by mass media advertising (including both print and broadcast advertising) shall be deemed to be individual policies. For the purpose of calculating the refund or credit required under paragraph (1)(B) for a policy issued before the date specified in subsection (p)(1)(C) of this section, the refund or credit calculation shall be based on the aggregate benefits provided and premiums collected under all such policies issued by an insurer in a State (separated as to individual and group policies) and shall be based only on aggregate benefits provided and premiums collected under such policies after the date specified in section 171(m)(4) of the Social Security Act Amendments of 1994.

(2)(A) Paragraph (1)(B) shall be applied with respect to each type of policy by standard package. Paragraph (1)(B) shall not apply to a policy until 12 months following issue. The Comptroller General, in consultation with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, shall submit to Congress a report containing recommendations on adjustment in the percentages under paragraph (1)(A) that may be appropriate. In the case of a policy issued before the date specified in subsection (p)(1)(C) of this section, paragraph (1)(B) shall not apply until 1 year after the date specified in section 171(m)(4) of the Social Security Act Amendments of 1994.

(B) A refund or credit required under paragraph (1)(B) shall be made to each policyholder insured under the applicable policy as of the last day of the year involved.

(C) Such a refund or credit shall include interest from the end of the calendar year involved until the date of the refund or credit at a rate as specified by the Secretary for this purpose from time to time which is not less than the average rate of interest for 13-week Treasury notes.

(D) For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (1)(B), refunds or credits against premiums due shall be made, with respect to a calendar year, not later than the third quarter of the succeeding calendar year.


(3) The provisions of this subsection do not preempt a State from requiring a higher percentage than that specified in paragraph (1)(A).

(4) The Secretary shall submit in October of each year (beginning with 1993) a report to the Committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate on loss ratios under medicare supplemental policies and the use of sanctions, such as a required rebate or credit or the disallowance of premium increases, for policies that fail to meet the requirements of this subsection (relating to loss ratios). Such report shall include a list of the policies that failed to comply with such loss ratio requirements or other requirements of this section.

(5) The Secretary may perform audits with respect to the compliance of medicare supplemental policies with the loss ratio requirements of this subsection and shall report the results of such audits to the State involved.

(6)(A) A person who fails to provide refunds or credits as required in paragraph (1)(B) is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $25,000 for each policy issued for which such failure occurred. The provisions of section 1320a–7a of this title (other than the first sentence of subsection (a) and other than subsection (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a–7a(a) of this title.

(B) Each issuer of a policy subject to the requirements of paragraph (1)(B) shall be liable to the policyholder or, in the case of a group policy, to the certificate holder for credits required under such paragraph.



(s) Coverage for pre-existing conditions(1) If a medicare supplemental policy replaces another medicare supplemental policy, the issuer of the replacing policy shall waive any time periods applicable to preexisting conditions, waiting period, elimination periods and probationary periods in the new medicare supplemental policy for similar benefits to the extent such time was spent under the original policy.

(2)(A) The issuer of a medicare supplemental policy may not deny or condition the issuance or effectiveness of a medicare supplemental policy, or discriminate in the pricing of the policy, because of health status, claims experience, receipt of health care, or medical condition in the case of an individual for whom an application is submitted prior to or during the 6 month period beginning with the first month as of the first day on which the individual is 65 years of age or older and is enrolled for benefits under part B of this subchapter.

(B) Subject to subparagraphs (C) and (D), subparagraph (A) shall not be construed as preventing the exclusion of benefits under a policy, during its first 6 months, based on a pre-existing condition for which the policyholder received treatment or was otherwise diagnosed during the 6 months before the policy became effective.

(C) If a medicare supplemental policy or certificate replaces another such policy or certificate which has been in effect for 6 months or longer, the replacing policy may not provide any time period applicable to pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, elimination periods, and probationary periods in the new policy or certificate for similar benefits.

(D) In the case of a policy issued during the 6-month period described in subparagraph (A) to an individual who is 65 years of age or older as of the date of issuance and who as of the date of the application for enrollment has a continuous period of creditable coverage (as defined in section 2701(c) 44 See References in Text note below. of the Public Health Service Act) of—(i) at least 6 months, the policy may not exclude benefits based on a pre-existing condition; or

(ii) less than 6 months, if the policy excludes benefits based on a preexisting condition, the policy shall reduce the period of any preexisting condition exclusion by the aggregate of the periods of creditable coverage (if any, as so defined) applicable to the individual as of the enrollment date.
