In subsection (b), the words “within the period specified in section 41301(a) of this title” are substituted for “within 3 years after the cause of action accrued” because the time limit is restated in section 41301(a) instead of in this section. The words “upon petition of the complainant” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “after notice and hearing” are omitted as unnecessary because of section 41304(a) of the revised title.
