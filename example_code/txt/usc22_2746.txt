References in TextSection 506(a), referred to in subsecs. (a) and (b), is section 506(a) of Pub. L. 102–511, which was classified to section 5856(a) of this title and was omitted from the Code. Section 506(a) directed amendment of section 221 of Pub. L. 102–228, set out as a note under section 2551 of this title, but did not become effective, pursuant to section 5856(c) of this title.
The Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 1991, referred to in subsec. (c)(2), is title II of Pub. L. 102–228, Dec. 12, 1991, 105 Stat. 1693. The reference to subtitle B of the Act probably means part B of title II of Pub. L. 102–228, which is set out as a note under section 2551 of this title. Title II of Pub.
