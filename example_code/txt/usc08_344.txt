“Sec. 301. (a) The Secretary shall, in accordance with the provisions of this title, make payments to State educational agencies for fiscal year 1981, and for each subsequent fiscal year for the purpose set forth in section 302.

“(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection and in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, the amount of the grant to which a State educational agency is entitled under this title for any fiscal year shall be equal to the sum of—“(A) the amount equal to the product of (i) the number of eligible participants enrolled during the period for which the determination is made in elementary or secondary public schools under the jurisdiction of each local educational agency described under paragraph (2) within that State, or in any elementary or secondary nonpublic school within the district served by each such local educational agency, who have been eligible participants less than one year, multiplied by (ii) $700;

“(B) the amount equal to the product of (i) the number of eligible participants enrolled during the period for which the determination is made in elementary or secondary public schools under the jurisdiction of each local educational agency described under paragraph (2) within that State, or in any elementary or secondary nonpublic school within the district served by each such local educational agency, who have been eligible participants at least one year but not more than two years, multiplied by (ii) $500; and

“(C) the product of (i) the number of eligible participants enrolled during the period for which the determination is made in elementary or secondary public schools under the jurisdiction of each local educational agency described under paragraph (2) within that State, or in any elementary or secondary nonpublic school within the district served by each such local educational agency, who have been eligible participants more than two years but not more than three years, multiplied by (ii) $300.


“(2) The local educational agencies referred to in paragraph (1) are those local educational agencies in which the sum of the number of eligible participants who are enrolled in elementary or secondary public schools under the jurisdiction of such agencies, or in elementary or secondary nonpublic schools within the districts served by such agencies, during the fiscal year for which the payments are to be made under this title, and are receiving supplementary educational services during such period, is equal to—“(A) at least 500; or

“(B) at least 5 percent of the total number of students enrolled in such public or nonpublic schools during such fiscal year;


whichever number is less. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, the local educational agencies referred to in paragraph (1) shall include local educational agencies eligible to receive assistance by reason of the last sentence of section 3(b) and section 3(c)(2)(B) of the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, Eighty-first Congress) [formerly 20 U.S.C. 238(b) and (c)(2)(B)], relating to Federal impact aid, subject to paragraph (5) of this subsection.

“(3) The amount of the grant to which a State educational agency is otherwise entitled for any fiscal year, as determined under paragraph (1), shall be reduced by the amounts made available under any other Federal law to agencies or other entities for educational, or education-related, services or activities within the State because of the significant concentration of eligible participants. The amount of the reduction required under this paragraph shall be determined by the Secretary in a manner consistent with subsection (c).

“(4) For the purpose of this subsection, the term ‘State’ does not include Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. The entitlements of such jurisdictions shall be determined in the manner specified in section 103, but for purposes of this title and section 105 any payments made under section 103 for the purposes set forth in section 302 shall be considered to be payments under this title.

“(5) The amount of the grant to which a State educational agency is entitled as a result of the last sentence of paragraph (2) shall be limited to eligible participants who meet the requirements of section 101(4).


“(c) Determinations by the Secretary under this title for any period with respect to the number of eligible participants and the amount of the reduction under subsection (b)(3) shall be made, whenever actual satisfactory data are not available, on the basis of estimates. No such determination shall operate because of an underestimate or overestimate to deprive any State educational agency of its entitlement to any payment (or the amount thereof) under this title to which such agency would be entitled had such determination been made on the basis of accurate data.

“(d) Whenever the Secretary determines that any amount of a payment made to a State under this title for a fiscal year will not be used by such State for carrying out the purpose for which the payment was made, the Secretary shall make such amount available for carrying out such purpose to one or more other States to the extent the Secretary determines that such other States will be able to use such additional amount for carrying out such purpose. Any amount made available to a State from an appropriation for a fiscal year in accordance with the preceding sentence shall, for purposes of this title, be regarded as part of such State’s payment (as determined under subsection (b)) for such year, but shall remain available until the end of the succeeding fiscal year.
