(R.S. § 2218; June 5, 1924, ch. 264, 43 Stat. 394; Mar. 3, 1925, ch. 462, 43 Stat. 1144; 1946 Reorg. Plan No. 3, § 403, eff. July 16, 1946, 11 F.R. 7876, 60 Stat. 1100.)

Codification
The original text of R.S. § 2218 provided for completion of surveys “in the several surveying-districts for which surveyors general have been, or may be, appointed” and also provided that “the surveyor general thereof shall be required to deliver over” all papers appertaining to land titles within the district, “and the office of surveyor general in every such district shall thereafter cease and be discontinued.” The references to the surveyors general were omitted in view of act Mar. 3, 1925 (classified to section 51 of this title) abolishing office of surveyor general and transferring its activities to the Field Surveying Service, under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Supervisor of Surveys. See, also, Transfer of Functions note below.
R.S. § 2207, formerly cited as a credit to this section, which provided for appointment of surveyors general, was superseded by act Mar. 3, 1925 (classified to section 51 of this title) and repealed by act Mar. 3, 1933, ch. 202, § 1, 47 Stat. 1429.
Act June 5, 1924, appropriated funds for use in making the surveys in twelve districts.
Act May 25, 1906, ch. 2554, 34 Stat. 199, provided for a survey, pursuant to R.S. § 2218, of unsurveyed lands in Louisiana, and was omitted.
Provisions of act Oct. 2, 1888, ch. 1069, 25 Stat. 525, which provided for transfer to State officials of field notes, maps, records and other papers appertaining to land surveys in Nebraska and Iowa, were omitted.
All records, etc., belonging to office of recorder of land titles for Missouri were delivered to State upon discontinuance of office, by provisions of act June 6, 1874, ch. 223, § 3, and act July 31, 1876, ch. 246.
R.S. § 2218 derived from acts June 12, 1840, ch. 36, § 1, 5 Stat. 384; July 31, 1876, ch. 246, 19 Stat. 121.
