References in TextSection 5538 of this title, referred to in subsec. (e), was in the original “section 103 of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2005” and was translated as reading “section 102” of that Act, meaning section 102 of div. G of Pub. L. 108–447, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because section 103 of div. G of Pub. L. 108–447 does not relate to the Net Expenses of Telecommunications Revolving Fund.
