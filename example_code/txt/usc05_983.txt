“(c) Applicability; Related Provisions.—“(1) Prospective rules.—Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the amendments made by this section [amending this section and sections 3502 and 8461 of this title] shall apply with respect to moves occurring on or after the effective date of the regulations under subsection (b). Moves occurring on or after the date of the enactment of this Act [Feb. 10, 1996] and before the effective date of such regulations shall be subject to applicable provisions of title 5, United States Code, disregarding the amendments made by this section, except that any individual making an election pursuant to this sentence shall be ineligible to make an election otherwise allowable under paragraph (2).

“(2) Retroactive rules.—“(A) In general.—The regulations under subsection (b) shall include provisions for the application of sections 8347(q) and 8461(n) of title 5, United States Code, as amended by this section, with respect to any individual who, at any time after December 31, 1965, and before the effective date of such regulations, moved between positions in circumstances that would have qualified such individual to make an election under the provisions of such section 8347(q) or 8461(n), as so amended, if such provisions had then been in effect.

“(B) Deadline; related provisions.—An election pursuant to this paragraph—“(i) shall be made within 1 year after the effective date of the regulations under subsection (b), and

“(ii) shall have the same force and effect as if it had been timely made at the time of the move,


  except that no such election may be made by any individual—
“(I) who has previously made, or had an opportunity to make, an election under section 8347(q) or 8461(n) of title 5, United States Code (as in effect before being amended by this section); however, this subclause shall not be considered to render an individual ineligible, based on an opportunity arising out of a move occurring during the period described in the second sentence of paragraph (1), if no election has in fact been made by such individual based on such move;

“(II) who has not, since the move on which eligibility for the election is based, remained continuously subject (disregarding any break in service of less than 3 days) to CSRS or FERS or both seriatim (if the move was from a NAFI position) or any retirement system (or 2 or more such systems seriatim) established for employees described in section 2105(c) of such title (if the move was to a NAFI position); or

“(III) if such election would be based on a move to the Civil Service Retirement System from a retirement system established for employees described in section 2105(c) of such title.


“(C) Transfers of contributions.—“(i) In general.—If an individual makes an election under this paragraph to be transferred back to a retirement system in which such individual previously participated (in this section referred to as the ‘previous system’), all individual contributions (including interest) and Government contributions to the retirement system in which such individual is then currently participating (in this section referred to as the ‘current system’), excluding those made to the Thrift Savings Plan or any other defined contribution plan, which are attributable to periods of service performed since the move on which the election is based, shall be paid to the fund, account, or other repository for contributions made under the previous system.

“(iii) Condition subsequent relating to deficiency in payments relative to amounts needed to ensure that benefits are fully funded.—     “(I) In general.—Except as provided in subclause (II), the payment described in clause (i) shall not be made (and the election to which it relates shall be ineffective) if the actuarial present value of the future benefits that would be payable under the previous system with respect to service performed by such individual after the move on which the election under this paragraph is based and before the effective date of the election, exceeds the total amounts required to be transferred to the previous system under the preceding provisions of this subparagraph with respect to such service, as determined by the authority administering such previous system (in this section referred to as the ‘administrative authority’).

     “(II) Payment of deficiency.—A determination of a deficiency under this clause shall not render an election ineffective if the individual pays or arranges to pay, at a time and in a manner satisfactory to such administrative authority, the full amount of the deficiency described in subclause (I).



“(D) Alternative election for an individual then participating in fers.—“(i) Applicability.—This subparagraph applies with respect to any individual who—     “(I) is then currently participating in FERS; and

“(ii) Election.—An individual described in clause (i) may, instead of making an election for which such individual is otherwise eligible under this paragraph, elect to have all prior qualifying NAFI service of such individual treated as creditable service for purposes of any annuity under FERS payable out of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.

“(iii) Qualifying nafi service.—For purposes of this subparagraph, the term ‘qualifying NAFI service’ means any service which, but for this subparagraph, would be creditable for purposes of any retirement system established for employees described in section 2105(c) of title 5, United States Code.

“(E) Alternative election for an individual then participating in a nafi retirement system.—“(i) Applicability.—This subparagraph applies with respect to any individual who—     “(I) is then currently participating in any retirement system established for employees described in section 2105(c) of title 5, United States Code (in this subparagraph referred to as a ‘NAFI retirement system’); and
