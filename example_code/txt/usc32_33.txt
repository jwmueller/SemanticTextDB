(b) Under regulations to be prescribed by the President, the capacity and general fitness of an officer of the National Guard for continued Federal recognition may be investigated at any time by an efficiency board composed of commissioned officers of—(1) the Regular Army or the Army National Guard of the United States, or both, who out-rank him and who are detailed by the Secretary of the Army, if he is a member of the Army National Guard; or

(2) the Regular Air Force or the Air National Guard of the United States, or both, who outrank him and who are detailed by the Secretary of the Air Force, if he is a member of the Air National Guard.


If the findings of the board are unfavorable to the officer and are approved by the President, his Federal recognition shall be withdrawn.

In subsection (a) the words “ceases to have the qualifications prescribed under section 300 of this title” are substituted for 32:154 (last 26 words of last par.), since it is implicit that a member who could not be paid would lose his federally recognized status (see JAGA 1953/9033, 3 Dec. 1953). The last 23 words of subsection (a) are inserted as a necessary implication of the rule stated in section 309(c) of this title.
In subsection (b), the words “or warrant officer” are omitted, since section 101(9) of this title defines “officer” to include warrant officers. The word “detailed” is substituted for the word “appointed”, since the filling of the positions involved is not appointment to an office in the constitutional sense. The word “commissioned” is inserted after the words “composed of”, since the word “officer” alone, in 32:115, referred to a commissioned officer only (see opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1953/4078, 6 May 1953)). The words “who outrank him” are substituted for the words “senior in rank to the officer under investigation”.
In subsection (c), the opening clause is substituted for the words “such transfer”. The words “his Federal recognition is withdrawn” are substituted for the words “shall terminate his federally recognized National Guard or Air National Guard status”.
