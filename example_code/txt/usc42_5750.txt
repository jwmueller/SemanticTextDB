§ 8373. Conservation in Federal facilities, contracts, and financial assistance programs(a) Federal facilities(1) Each Federal agency owning or operating any electric powerplant shall comply with any prohibition, term, condition, or other substantial or procedural requirement under this chapter, to the same extent as would be the case if such powerplant were owned or operated by a nongovernmental person.

(2) The President may, by order, exempt from the application of paragraph (1) any powerplant owned or operated by any Federal agency, if the President determines that—(A) such use is in the paramount interest of the United States and that the powerplant involved is a component of or is used solely in connection with any weaponry, equipment, aircraft, vessels, vehicles or other classes or categories of property which—(i) are owned or operated by the Armed Forces of the United States (including the Coast Guard) or by the National Guard of any State; and

(ii) are uniquely military in nature; or


(B) there is a lack of appropriation for such use but only if the President specifically requested such appropriations as a part of the budgetary process and the Congress failed to make available such requested appropriation.


Such order shall not take effect until 60 days after a copy of such order has been transmitted to each House of the Congress. The President shall review each such determination every 2 years and submit a report to the Congress on the results of such review.


(b) Federal contracts and financial assistance(1) In order to implement the purposes of this chapter, the President shall, not later than 30 days after the effective date of this chapter, issue an order—(A) requiring each Federal agency which is authorized to extend Federal assistance by way of grant, loan, contract, or other form of financial assistance, to promptly effectuate the purposes of this chapter relating to the conservation of petroleum and natural gas, by rule, in such contracting or assistance activities within 180 days after issuance of such order, and

(B) setting forth procedures, sanctions, penalties, and such other provisions as the President determines necessary to carry out such requirement effectively, including a requirement that each agency annually transmit to the President, and make available to the public, a report on the actions taken and to be taken to implement such order.


(2) The President may exempt by order any specific grant, loan, contract, or other form of financial assistance from all or part of the provisions of this subsection if he determines such exemption is in the national interest. The President shall notify the Congress in writing of such exemption at least 60 days before it is effective.

(3) The President or any Federal agency may not use the authority granted under paragraph (1) to require compliance, including the use of coal, by any person or facility with any prohibition under other sections of this chapter if such person or facility has been specifically determined by the Secretary as subject to such prohibition or has been exempted from the application of such prohibition.

By the authority vested in me as President of the United States of America by Section 403(b) of the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 (92 Stat. 3318; Public Law 95–620) [42 U.S.C. 8373(b)] and Section 301 of Title 3 of the United States Code, in order to encourage additional conservation of petroleum and natural gas by recipients of Federal financial assistance, it is hereby ordered as follows:
1–101. Each Federal agency, as that term is defined in Section 103(a)(25) of the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 (92 Stat. 3297) [42 U.S.C. 8302(a)(25)], shall effectuate through its financial assistance programs the purposes of that Act relating to the conservation of petroleum and natural gas.
1–102. Each Federal agency which extends financial assistance shall review those programs of financial assistance and identify those which are most likely to offer opportunities for significant conservation of petroleum and natural gas.
1–103. Within two months, and annually thereafter, each agency shall publish for comment a list of those programs which it has identified as likely to offer significant opportunity for conservation. The public shall be given 60 days to submit comments, including suggestions for rules which would effectuate the conservation purposes of the Act [see Short Title note set out under 42 U.S.C. 8301].
1–104. After receiving public comment and suggestions, and after consulting with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, each agency shall publish proposed rules designed to achieve conservation of petroleum and natural gas in connection with the receipt of financial assistance.
Proposed rules should be published within 30 days of the close of the comment period under Section 1–103.
1–105. Final rules shall be adopted by each agency in accordance with the provisions of Sections 102(b) [42 U.S.C. 8301(b)], 403(b) [42 U.S.C. 8373(b)] and 701(a) [42 U.S.C. 8411(a)] of the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978, and the provisions of this Order, not later than 180 days from the date of this Order.
1–106. No one shall be awarded any financial assistance unless that award complies with the provisions of the conservation rules adopted by the agency pursuant to this Order.

To the extent permitted by law and where not inconsistent with the financial assistance program, final rules may provide for the reduction or suspension of financial assistance under any award. Such reduction or suspension shall not be ordered until there has been an opportunity for a hearing on the record, and shall last for such time as the recipient fails to comply with the terms of the conservation rule.
1–108. No conservation rule shall be adopted which is inconsistent with the statutory provisions establishing the financial assistance program.
1–109. No conservation rule shall be used to enforce compliance with any prohibition under the Act [see Short Title note set out under 42 U.S.C. 8301] against any person or facility which has been specifically determined by the Secretary of Energy as subject to or exempt from a prohibition under the Act. The conservation rules shall be used to enforce other new ways of achieving the purposes of the Act related to the conservation of petroleum and natural gas.
1–110. In order to assess the effectiveness of this program, each agency shall annually prepare a report on its activities in accord with Section 403(b)(1)(B) of the Act [42 U.S.C. 8373(b)]. These reports shall be submitted to the President through the Secretary of Energy.
