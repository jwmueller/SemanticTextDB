Applicability of the source law to the Air Force is based on Transfer Order No. 25(zzz), of the Secretary of Defense, dated October 14, 1948. Its applicability, other than to the Army and the Air Force, is based upon an opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, JAG 135: DDC; dmt.; 4229, dated July 29, 1960. The words “(but not above that of pay grade O–7)” are substituted for section 235a (proviso) of existing title 37.
