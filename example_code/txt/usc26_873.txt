(b) Amount of credit(1) In generalThe amount of the credit determined under this subsection with respect to any qualified zone academy bond is the amount equal to the product of—(A) the credit rate determined by the Secretary under paragraph (2) for the month in which such bond was issued, multiplied by

(B) the face amount of the bond held by the taxpayer on the credit allowance date.


(2) DeterminationDuring each calendar month, the Secretary shall determine a credit rate which shall apply to bonds issued during the following calendar month. The credit rate for any month is the percentage which the Secretary estimates will permit the issuance of qualified zone academy bonds without discount and without interest cost to the issuer.



(c) Limitation based on amount of taxThe credit allowed under subsection (a) for any taxable year shall not exceed the excess of—(1) the sum of the regular tax liability (as defined in section 26(b)) plus the tax imposed by section 55, over
