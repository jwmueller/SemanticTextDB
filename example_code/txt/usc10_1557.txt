The number of units specified in the transaction shall be determined on the basis of a balancing of the level of the investment made in the project by the participants other than the Federal Government with the interest of the Federal Government in having competition among sources in the acquisition of the product or products prototyped under the project.

“(2) A follow-on production contract provided for in a transaction under paragraph (1) may be awarded to the participants in the transaction without the use of competitive procedures, notwithstanding the requirements of section 2304 of title 10, United States Code, if—“(A) competitive procedures were used for the selection of parties for participation in the transaction;

“(i) Period of Authority.—The authority to carry out projects under subsection (a) shall terminate at the end of September 30, 2018.”
