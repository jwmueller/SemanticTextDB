§ 1104. Restrictions on use of illustrations
Appropriations made for printing and binding may not be used for an illustration, engraving, or photograph in a document or report ordered printed by Congress unless the order to print expressly authorizes it, nor in a document or report of an executive department, independent office or establishment of the Government until the head of the executive department or Government establishment certifies in a letter transmitting the report that the illustration, engraving, or photograph is necessary and relates entirely to the transaction of public business.
(Pub. L. 90–620, Oct. 22, 1968, 82 Stat. 1261.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on 44 U.S. Code, 1964 ed., § 118 (Mar. 3, 1905, ch. 1483, § 1, 33 Stat. 1213).
The term “executive department, independent office, or establishment of the Government” is substituted for “executive department or other Government establishment” for uniformity.
