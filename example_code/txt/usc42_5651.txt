“(a) Findings.—The Congress finds that—“(1) protecting the existing stock of unsubsidized privately held lower income housing through the rehabilitation and revitalization of declining neighborhoods is essential to a national housing policy that seeks to increase the availability of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families;

“(2) the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, the anchor of the national neighborhood housing services network, was chartered by Congress more than 10 years ago to revitalize neighborhoods for the benefit of current residents by mobilizing public, private, and community resources at the neighborhood level;

“(3) the national neighborhood housing services network has proven its worth as a successful cost-effective program relying largely on local initiative for the specific design of local programs;

“(4) the national neighborhood housing services network has had more than 10 years of experience in revitalizing declining neighborhoods, creating housing for low- and moderate-income families, and equipping residents with skills and resources required to maintain safe and healthy communities; and

“(5) expanding upon the existing capabilities, resources, and potential of the national neighborhood housing services network is a cost-effective response to the affordable housing and neighborhood revitalization needs confronting the Nation, and is a strong preventive measure in addressing the national tragedy of homelessness.


“(b) Purpose.—It is the purpose of this section [amending this section] to authorize appropriations for the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation for fiscal years 1991 and 1992 to permit the corporation—“(1) to carefully expand the capacities of the national neighborhood housing services network;

“(3) to increase and provide ongoing technical and capacity development assistance to neighborhood housing services and related public-private partnership-based nonprofit institutions involved in the revitalization of neighborhoods for the benefit of current residents, rehabilitation, preservation of existing housing stock, and production of additional housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income families;

“(4) to expand the loan purchase capacity of the national neighborhood housing services secondary market, operated by Neighborhood Housing Services of America, for loans made by neighborhood housing services to residents who are unable to meet conventional lending standards, and other loans for community development purposes;

“(5) to provide increased capacity development and matching grants to preserve existing privately held unsubsidized rental housing affordable to low- and moderate-income households and to create flexible strategies effective in the diverse economic and geographic environments of the Nation;

“(6) to make grants to provide incentives to extend low-income housing use in connection with properties subject to prepayment pursuant to the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Ownership [Homeownership] Act of 1990 [12 U.S.C. 4101 et seq.];

“(7) to increase the resources available to neighborhood housing services network programs for the purchase of multifamily and single-family properties owned by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for rehabilitation (if necessary) and sale to low- and moderate-income families;

“(8) to expand the national mutual housing association demonstration by providing technical assistance and matching grants to assist low- and moderate-income families to participate in such associations;
