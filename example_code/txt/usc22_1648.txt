The amount of such reimbursement shall be credited to the current applicable appropriations, funds, or accounts of such agency.


(e) Establishment of accountsIn furnishing assistance under this chapter, accounts may be established on the books of any agency of the United States Government or, on terms and conditions approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, in banking institutions in the United States, (1) against which letters of commitment may be issued which shall constitute recordable obligations of the United States Government, and moneys due or to become due under such letters of commitment shall be assignable under the Assignment of Claims Act of 1940, as amended 11 See References in Text note below.

(f) Credits made by Export-Import Bank of the United StatesCredits made by the Export-Import Bank of the United States with funds allocated thereto under subsection (a) of this section or under section 1782(a) 1 of this title, shall not be considered in determining whether the Bank has outstanding at any one time loans and guaranties to the extent of the limitation imposed by section 635e of title 12.
