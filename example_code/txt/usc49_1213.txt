(D) the review of waste management contracts; and

(E) the potential for cost savings or the generation of revenue.



(b) Airport Development Project Grant Application Approval.—The Secretary may approve an application under this subchapter for an airport development project grant for an airport only if the Secretary is satisfied that—(1) the sponsor, a public agency, or the Government holds good title to the areas of the airport used or intended to be used for the landing, taking off, or surface maneuvering of aircraft, or that good title will be acquired;

(2) the interests of the community in or near which the project may be located have been given fair consideration; and

(3) the application provides touchdown zone and centerline runway lighting, high intensity runway lighting, or land necessary for installing approach light systems that the Secretary, considering the category of the airport and the kind and volume of traffic using it, decides is necessary for safe and efficient use of the airport by aircraft.


(c) Environmental Requirements.—(1) The Secretary may approve an application under this subchapter for an airport development project involving the location of an airport or runway or a major runway extension—(A) only if the sponsor certifies to the Secretary that—(i) an opportunity for a public hearing was given to consider the economic, social, and environmental effects of the location and the location’s consistency with the objectives of any planning that the community has carried out;
