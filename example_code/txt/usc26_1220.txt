“SEC. 933. WEIGHT-DISTANCE TAXES.“The Secretary of Transportation shall conduct a study to evaluate the feasibility and ability of weight-distance truck taxes to provide the greatest degree of equity among highway users, to ease the costs of compliance of such taxes, and to improve the efficiency by which such taxes might be administered. Such study shall also include an evaluation of the evasion potential for weight-distance taxes and an assessment of the benefits to interstate commerce of replacing all Federal truck taxes (other than fuel taxes) with a weight-distance tax.
