 34 U.S.C. 841h.Nov. 5, 1941, ch. 468, § 8; added Aug. 4, 1942, ch. 547, § 15(h), 56 Stat. 740.


In subsection (a) the authority to designate student aviation pilots is expressly set forth.
The portion of 34 U.S.C. 841h that provides that student aviation pilots who are qualified civilian aviators shall be given a brief refresher course in flight training is contained in subsection (c). The remainder of 34 U.S.C. 841h, which provides that such pilots shall not be considered as having been designated pursuant to 34 U.S.C. 841a–841h, is reflected in subsection (b) by making that subsection applicable only to student aviation pilots who are not qualified civilian aviators. No other consequences attach to designation as student aviation pilots under the particular provisions. In subsection (b) the word “continuous” is omitted as covered by the word “period”, and the subsection is written as a condition precedent to designation, because it is so interpreted.
In subsection (c) the words “enlisted in or transferred to pilot ratings” are omitted as surplusage.
Subsection (e) states expressly the authority to designate aviation pilots, which is implied in 34 U.S.C. 841a, 841b, and 841d.
In subsection (f) the words “pay grade E–5” are substituted for the words “third grade” in 34 U.S.C. 841b to conform to the terminology of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37 U.S.C. 231 et seq.).
In subsection (h) the words “of the Naval Reserve or the Marine Corps Reserve” are substituted for the words “designated as such in accordance with sections 841a and 841b of this title” for uniformity.

See section 201 of Title 37, Pay and Allowances of the Uniformed Services.
