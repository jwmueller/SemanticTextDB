Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 41(9) and 371(2) (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§ 24, par. 9, 256, par. 2, 36 Stat. 1092, 1160).
Word “fine” was inserted so that this section will apply to the many provisions in the United States Code for fines which are essentially civil. (See, also, section 2461 of this title and reviser’s note thereunder.)
Words “pecuniary or otherwise” were added to make this section expressly applicable to both pecuniary and property forfeitures. The original section was so construed in Miller v. United States, 1870, 11 Wall. 268, 20 L.Ed. 135; Tyler v. Defrees, 1870, 11 Wall. 331, and The Rosemary, C.C.A. 1928, 26 F.2d 354, certiorari denied 49 S.Ct. 23, 278 U.S. 619, 73 L.Ed. 542.
