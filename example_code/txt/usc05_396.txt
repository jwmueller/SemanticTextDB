In paragraph (1), the term “Executive agency” is coextensive with and substituted for “executive department or independent agency in the executive branch of the Government including a Government-owned or controlled corporation” in view of the definition of “Executive agency” in section 105. Application to the General Accounting Office (included in the term “Executive agency”) is based on former section 933a.
Paragraph (2) is supplied because the definition of “employee” in section 2105 does not encompass individuals employed by the government of the District of Columbia.
Paragraph (3) is supplied for clarity and convenience.
