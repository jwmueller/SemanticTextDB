§ 6308. Use of multiple relationships for different parts of jointly financed projects
This chapter does not require an executive agency to establish only one relationship between the United States Government and a State, a local government, or other recipient on a jointly financed project involving amounts from more than one program or appropriation when different relationships would otherwise be appropriate for different parts of the project.
