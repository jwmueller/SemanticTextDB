§ 7671. Payment of costs and expenses from prize fund(a) Payment may not be made from a prize fund except upon the order of the court. The court may, at any time, order the payment, from the deposit made with the Treasurer or public depositary in the cause, of costs or charges accrued and allowed.

(b) When the cause is finally disposed of, the court shall order the Treasurer or public de­positary to pay the costs and charges allowed and unpaid. If the final decree is for restitution, or if there is no money subject to the order of the court in the cause, costs or charges allowed by the court and not paid by the claimants shall be paid out of the fund for paying the expenses of suits in which the United States is a party or is interested.
