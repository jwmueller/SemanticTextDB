(b) InventoriesIn determining sales policies for basic agricultural commodities or storable nonbasic commodities, the Corporation should consider the establishment of such policies with respect to prices, terms, and conditions as the Corporation determines will not discourage or deter manufacturers, processors, and dealers from acquiring and carrying normal inventories of the commodity of the current crop.


(c) Sales price restrictions(1) In generalExcept as otherwise provided in this section, the Corporation shall not sell any basic agricultural commodity or storable nonbasic commodity at less than 115 percent of the lower of—(A) the current national average price support loan rate for the commodity adjusted for the current market differentials reflecting grade, quality, location, reasonable carrying charges, and other factors determined appropriate by the Corporation; or

(5) Upland cottonThe Commodity Credit Corporation shall sell upland cotton for unrestricted use at the same price the Corporation sells upland cotton for export, but in no event at less than the amount provided for in paragraph (1).



(d) Nonapplication of sales price restrictionsThe foregoing restrictions of this section shall not apply to—(1) sales for new or byproduct uses;

(2) sales of peanuts and oilseeds for the extraction of oil;

(f) Efficient operations(1) In generalSubject to paragraph (2), the foregoing restrictions of this section shall not apply to sales of commodities the disposition of which is desirable in the interest of the effective and efficient conduct of the operations of the Corporation because of the small quantities involved, or because of age, location or questionable continued storability of the commodity.


(2) OffsetsThe sales shall be offset (if necessary) by the purchases of commodities as the Corporation determines is appropriate to prevent the sales from substantially impairing any price support program or unduly affecting market prices, except that the purchase price shall not exceed the Corporation’s minimum sales price for the commodities for unrestricted use.


(3) Competitive bid basisSubject to the sales price restrictions contained in this section, the Corporation may sell any basic agricultural commodity or storable nonbasic commodity on a competitive bid basis, if the sale is determined to be appropriate by the Secretary.

“(e) Terms.—(1) The Secretary may not make corn or other commodities available under this section to any domestic producer of ethanol that uses in excess of 30,000,000 bushels of corn or comparable commodity annually in producing ethanol.

Ex. Ord. No. 11336. Delegation of Authority Relating to Emergency Livestock Feed
Ex. Ord. No. 11336, Mar. 22, 1967, 32 F.R. 4489, provided:
By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 301 of Title 3 of the United States Code, and as President of the United States, it is ordered as follows:
Section 1. (a) The Secretary of Agriculture is hereby designated and empowered to exercise, without the approval, ratification, or other action of the President, the authority vested in the President by clause (1) of the fifth sentence of section 407 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1427), to the extent prescribed in subsection (b) of this section.
(b) Whenever the Secretary of Agriculture determines that the chronic economic distress of the needy members of an Indian tribe is materially increased by severe drought, flood, hurricane, blizzard, or other uncontrollable catastrophe affecting any reservation or other land designated for Indian use which is utilized by members of such tribe for grazing livestock, he may, under subsection (a) of this section, declare such reservation or other land to be an acute distress area because of unemployment or other economic reasons if he finds that the use of farm commodities or the products thereof made available by the Commodity Credit Corporation for livestock feed in that area will not displace or interfere with normal marketing of agricultural commodities.
Sec. 2. Federal assistance in relieving distress, extended as a result of action by the Secretary of Agriculture under the authority delegated by section 1 of this order, shall terminate in each instance upon notice by the Secretary of Agriculture.
Sec. 3. In carrying out the provisions of this order the Secretary of Agriculture shall maintain liaison with the Secretary of the Interior and shall consult with the latter as may be appropriate.
Sec. 4. The declaration contained in the letter of the President to the Secretary of Agriculture, dated February 1, 1965, that reservation lands in Arizona, Utah and New Mexico, which are grazed in common by Indian tribes, are an acute distress area shall continue in effect until January 1, 1968, or until such earlier date as may be fixed by notice of the Secretary of Agriculture published in the Federal Register.

Lyndon B. Johnson.
