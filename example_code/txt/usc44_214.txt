“SEC. 2. FINDINGS, DECLARATIONS, AND PURPOSES.“(a) Findings and Declarations.—The Congress finds and declares that—“(1) all Government records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy should be preserved for historical and governmental purposes;

“(2) all Government records concerning the assassination of President John F. Kennedy should carry a presumption of immediate disclosure, and all records should be eventually disclosed to enable the public to become fully informed about the history surrounding the assassination;

“(3) legislation is necessary to create an enforceable, independent, and accountable process for the public disclosure of such records;

“(4) legislation is necessary because congressional records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy would not otherwise be subject to public disclosure until at least the year 2029;

“(5) legislation is necessary because the Freedom of Information Act [5 U.S.C. 552], as implemented by the executive branch, has prevented the timely public disclosure of records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy;

“(6) legislation is necessary because [former] Executive Order No. 12356, entitled ‘National Security Information’ has eliminated the declassification and downgrading schedules relating to classified information across government and has prevented the timely public disclosure of records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy; and

“(7) most of the records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy are almost 30 years old, and only in the rarest cases is there any legitimate need for continued protection of such records.


“(b) Purposes.—The purposes of this Act are—“(1) to provide for the creation of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection at the National Archives and Records Administration; and

“(2) to require the expeditious public transmission to the Archivist and public disclosure of such records.
