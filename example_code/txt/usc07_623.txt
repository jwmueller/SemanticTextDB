(d) Proposed prohibition or regulation; authority of Secretary of Agriculture to proceedThe Secretary may proceed with the proposed prohibition or regulation if the Secretary receives the advice and concurrence of the United States Trade Representative within 60 days of the notification under subsection (c)(1).
