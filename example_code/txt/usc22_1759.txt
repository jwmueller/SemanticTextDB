(B) conducting demonstration projects in such countries or areas.


None of the funds made available to carry out the purposes of clauses (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of this section may be used to pay the administrative costs of any program or project, other than a demonstration project, or to assist any program or project of a paramilitary or military nature.
