The Secretary shall notify each State of any adjustment made under this paragraph and the percentage of the total sums appropriated under section 15029 of this title that the adjusted allotment represents not later than 6 months before the beginning of the fiscal year in which such adjustment is to take effect.

(6) Increase in allotmentsIn any year in which the total amount appropriated under section 15029 of this title for a fiscal year exceeds the total amount appropriated under such section (or a corresponding provision) for the preceding fiscal year by a percentage greater than the most recent percentage change in the Consumer Price Index published by the Secretary of Labor under section 720(c)(1) of title 29 (if the percentage change indicates an increase), the Secretary shall increase each of the minimum allotments described in paragraphs (3) and (4). The Secretary shall increase each minimum allotment by an amount that bears the same ratio to the amount of such minimum allotment (including any increases in such minimum allotment under this paragraph (or a corresponding provision) for prior fiscal years) as the amount that is equal to the difference between—(A) the total amount appropriated under section 15029 of this title for the fiscal year for which the increase in the minimum allotment is being made; minus

(B) the total amount appropriated under section 15029 of this title (or a corresponding provision) for the immediately preceding fiscal year,


bears to the total amount appropriated under section 15029 of this title (or a corresponding provision) for such preceding fiscal year.

(2) TimingThe Secretary may make such a reallotment from time to time, on such date as the Secretary may fix, but not earlier than 30 days after the Secretary has published notice of the intention of the Secretary to make the reallotment in the Federal Register.


(3) AmountsThe Secretary shall reallot the amount to other States with respect to which the Secretary has not made that determination. The Secretary shall reallot the amount in proportion to the original allotments of the other States for such fiscal year, but shall reduce such proportionate amount for any of the other States to the extent the proportionate amount exceeds the sum that the Secretary estimates the State needs and will be able to use during such period.


(4) Reallotment of reductionsThe Secretary shall similarly reallot the total of the reductions among the States whose proportionate amounts were not so reduced.
