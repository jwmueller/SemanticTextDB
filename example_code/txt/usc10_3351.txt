§ 9842. Settlement of accounts of line officers
The Comptroller General shall settle the account of a line officer of the Air Force for pay due the officer even if the officer cannot account for property entrusted to the officer or cannot make a monthly report or return, when the Comptroller General is satisfied that the inability to account for property or make a report or return was the result of the officer having been a prisoner, or of an accident or casualty of war.
(Added Pub. L. 97–258, § 2(b)(14)(B), Sept. 13, 1982, 96 Stat. 1058.)
