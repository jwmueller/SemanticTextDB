§ 718.

(2) When a draft report is submitted to an agency for comment, the Comptroller General shall make the draft report available on request to—(A) either House of Congress, a committee of Congress, or a member of Congress if the report was begun because of a request of the House, committee, or member; or

(B) the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives if the report was not begun because of a request of either House of Congress, a committee of Congress, or a member of Congress.


(3) This subsection is subject to statutory and executive order guidelines for handling and storing classified information and material.


(c) A final report of the Comptroller General shall include—(1) a statement of significant changes of a finding, conclusion, or recommendation in an earlier draft report because of comments on the draft by an agency;

(2) a statement of the reasons the changes were made; and

(3) for a draft report submitted under subsection (a) of this section, written comments of the agency submitted during the comment period.
