§ 301c. Incentive pay: submarine duty(a) Eligibility Requirements.—(1) Subject to regulations prescribed by the President, a member of the naval service who is entitled to basic pay, and (A) holds (or is in training leading to) a submarine duty designator, (B) is in and remains in the submarine service on a career basis, and (C) meets the requirements of paragraph (3), is entitled to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay in the amount prescribed pursuant to subsection (b).

(2) Subject to regulations prescribed by the President, a member of the naval service who is entitled to basic pay but is not entitled to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay under paragraph (1) is entitled to submarine duty incentive pay in the amount prescribed pursuant to subsection (b) for any period during which such member performs frequent and regular operational submarine duty (as defined in paragraph (5)) required by orders.

(3) To be entitled to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay through 26 years of service (as computed under section 205 of this title, but excluding, in the case of an officer, periods as an enlisted member before initial appointment as an officer), a member must perform operational submarine duties for at least 6 of the first 12, and at least 10 of the first 18, years of his submarine service. However, if a member performs the prescribed operational submarine duties for at least 8 but less than 10 of the first 18 years of his submarine service, he is entitled to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay for the first 22 years of his service (as computed under section 205 of this title, but excluding, in the case of an officer, periods as an enlisted member before initial appointment as an officer).

(4) If upon completion of either 12 or 18 years of submarine service it is determined that a member has failed to perform the minimum prescribed operational submarine duty requirements during the prescribed periods of time, his entitlement to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay ceases. If entitlement to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay ceases upon completion of 12 years of submarine service, entitlement to that pay may again commence upon completion of 18 years of submarine service if the minimum operational submarine duty requirements have been met, and such pay shall continue for the period of time prescribed in accordance with this section. However, if entitlement to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay ceases in the case of any member at the completion of either 12 or 18 years of submarine service or 26 years of service (as computed under section 205 of this title, but excluding, in the case of an officer, periods as an enlisted member before initial appointment as an officer), such member shall be entitled to that pay in the amount prescribed pursuant to subsection (b) for the performance of subsequent operational submarine duty, or for the performance of service as a member of a submarine operational command staff, if such member’s duties require serving on a submarine during underway operations.

(5) In this section:(A) The term “operational submarine duty” means duty—(i) while attached under competent orders to a submarine, while serving as an operator or crew member of an operational submersible (including an undersea exploration or research vehicle), while undergoing training preliminary to assignment to a nuclear-powered submarine, while undergoing rehabilitation after assignment to a nuclear-powered submarine, or, in the case of a member qualified in submarines, while attached as a member of a submarine operational command staff whose duties require serving on a submarine during underway operations—(I) during one calendar month: 48 hours, except that hours served underway in excess of 48 as a member of a submarine operational command staff during any of the immediately preceding five calendar months and not already used to qualify for incentive pay may be applied to satisfy the underway time requirements for the current month;

(II) during any two consecutive calendar months when the requirements of subclause (I) of this clause have not been met: 96 hours; or

(III) during any three consecutive calendar months when the requirements of subclause (II) of this clause have not been met: 144 hours;


(ii) while receiving instruction to prepare for assignment to a submarine of advanced design, or

(iii) while receiving instruction to prepare for a position of increased responsibility on a submarine.


(B) The term “submarine service” means the service performed, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Navy, by a member, and the years of submarine service are computed beginning with the effective date of the initial order to perform submarine service.



(b) Monthly Rates.—The Secretary of the Navy shall prescribe the monthly rates of submarine duty incentive pay, except that the maximum monthly rate may not exceed $1,000.

(c) Exceptions.—(1) An officer who fails of selection for assignment as an executive officer or commanding officer of a submarine or who declines to serve in either such position may not be paid submarine duty incentive pay except for periods during which the officer is serving on a submarine during underway operations.

(2) An enlisted member may not be paid continuous submarine duty incentive pay while serving ashore between submarine sea duty assignments unless the member has a sufficient period of enlistment (including any extension of an enlistment) remaining to be reassigned to submarine sea duty.


(d) Applicability to Certain Navy Reserve Duty.—Under regulations prescribed by the President and to the extent provided for by appropriations, when a member of the Navy Reserve who is entitled to compensation under section 206 of this title, performs, under orders, duty on a submarine during underway operations, he is eligible for an increase in such compensation equal to one-thirtieth of the monthly incentive pay prescribed pursuant to subsection (b) for the performance of that duty by a member of a corresponding grade and years of service who is entitled to basic pay. Such a member is eligible for the increase for each day served, for as long as he is qualified for it, during each regular period of appropriate duty.
