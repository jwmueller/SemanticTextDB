References in TextSection 12858 of this title, referred to in text, was in the original “section 311”, and was translated as reading “section 309”, meaning section 309 of Pub. L. 101–625, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because Pub. L. 101–625 does not contain a section 311.

Amendments1992—Pub. L. 102–550 amended section generally.
