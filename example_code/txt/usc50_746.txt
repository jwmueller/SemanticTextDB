References in TextThis chapter, referred to in text, was in the original “this title”, meaning title XXXII of div. C of Pub. L. 106–65, Oct. 5, 1999, 113 Stat. 953, as amended, which is classified principally to this chapter. For complete classification of title XXXII to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 2401 of this title and Tables.
