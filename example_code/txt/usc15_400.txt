Notwithstanding the exemption set forth in section 80a–6(f) of this title, section 80a–21 of this title shall apply to a business development company to the same extent as if it were a registered closed-end investment company, except that nothing in that section shall be deemed to prohibit—(1) any loan to a director, officer, or employee of, or general partner in, a business development company for the purpose of purchasing securities of such company as part of an executive compensation plan, if such loan meets the requirements of section 80a–56(j) of this title; or

(2) any loan to a company controlled by a business development company, which companies could be deemed to be under common control solely because a third person controls such business development company.
