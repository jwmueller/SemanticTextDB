(B) knowingly has failed, or caused another to fail, to disclose a material fact; and


(2) as a result of such false statement or representation, or of such nondisclosure, such person has received any payment under this part to which the person was not entitled.

(d) Payment to TreasuryAny amount recovered under this section shall be returned to the Treasury of the United States.
