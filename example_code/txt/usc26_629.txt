(4) DefinitionsFor purposes of paragraph (3)(A)—(A) Long partyThe term “long party” means, with respect to any underlying security of any notional principal contract, any party to the contract which is entitled to receive any payment pursuant to such contract which is contingent upon, or determined by reference to, the payment of a dividend from sources within the United States with respect to such underlying security.


(B) Short partyThe term “short party” means, with respect to any underlying security of any notional principal contract, any party to the contract which is not a long party with respect to such underlying security.


(C) Underlying securityThe term “underlying security” means, with respect to any notional principal contract, the security with respect to which the dividend referred to in paragraph (2)(B) is paid. For purposes of this paragraph, any index or fixed basket of securities shall be treated as a single security.



(5) Payments determined on gross basisFor purposes of this subsection, the term “payment” includes any gross amount which is used in computing any net amount which is transferred to or from the taxpayer.


(6) Prevention of over-withholdingIn the case of any chain of dividend equivalents one or more of which is subject to tax under subsection (a) or section 881, the Secretary may reduce such tax, but only to the extent that the taxpayer can establish that such tax has been paid with respect to another dividend equivalent in such chain, or is not otherwise due, or as the Secretary determines is appropriate to address the role of financial intermediaries in such chain. For purposes of this paragraph, a dividend shall be treated as a dividend equivalent.


(7) Coordination with chapters 3 and 4For purposes of chapters 3 and 4, each person that is a party to any contract or other arrangement that provides for the payment of a dividend equivalent shall be treated as having control of such payment.
