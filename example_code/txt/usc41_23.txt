In paragraph (1), the words “a contingency operation or”, and the text of 41 U.S.C. 259(d)(2)(A), are omitted because the increased simplified acquisition threshold established under section 32A of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (Public Law 93–400) in the case of a contract to be awarded and performed, or purchase to be made, outside the United States in support of a contingency operation supersedes the threshold established under this section. Section 32A is restated as section 1903 of the revised title.
