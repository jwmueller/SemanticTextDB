§ 951. Oath of office of clerks and deputies
Each clerk of court and his deputies shall take the following oath or affirmation before entering upon their duties: “I, ___ ___, having been appointed ___, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will truly and faithfully enter and record all orders, decrees, judgments and proceedings of such court, and will faithfully and impartially discharge all other duties of my office according to the best of my abilities and understanding. So help me God.”
(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 925.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 512 (R.S., § 794; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 291, 36 Stat. 1167).
Section 512 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., applied only to the Clerk of the Supreme Court and clerks and deputies of the district courts.
This section is applicable to the Supreme Court and to all courts established by act of Congress.
The last sentence of section 512 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., reading “The words ‘So help me God.’ shall be omitted in all cases where an affirmation is admitted instead of an oath,” was omitted as unnecessary because on affirmation such words would not be included. As revised, the section conforms with section 453 of this title providing for the form of judicial oath.
Minor changes were made in phraseology.
