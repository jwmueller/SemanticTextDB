§ 3109. Tax and loss bonds(a) The Secretary of the Treasury may issue tax and loss bonds of the United States Government and may buy, redeem, and make refunds under section 3111 of this title. The proceeds of the tax and loss bonds shall be used for expenditures authorized by law. Tax and loss bonds are nontransferrable except as provided by the Secretary, bear no interest, and shall be issued in amounts needed to allow persons to comply with section 832(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 832(e)). The Secretary may prescribe the amount of tax and loss bonds and the conditions under which the bonds will be issued as required by section 832(e).

(b) For a taxable year in which amounts are deducted from the mortgage guaranty account referred to in section 832(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 832(e)(3)), an amount of tax and loss bonds bought under section 832(e)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 832(e)(2)) shall be redeemed for the amount deducted from the account. The amount redeemed shall be applied as necessary to pay taxes due because of the inclusion under section 832(b)(1)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 832(b)(1)(E)) of amounts in gross income. The Secretary also may prescribe additional ways to redeem the bonds.
