Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 61a, 61g, 61n, 61s, 61u (Aug. 2, 1939, 11:50 a.m., E.S.T., ch. 410, §§ 2, 8, 53 Stat. 1147, 1148; July 19, 1940, ch. 640, § 1, 54 Stat. 767; Aug. 2, 1939, ch. 410, §§ 14, 19, as added July 19, 1940, ch. 640, § 4, 54 Stat. 767; Aug. 2, 1939, ch. 410, § 21, as added Oct. 24, 1942, ch. 620, 56 Stat. 986).
This section consolidates sections 61s, 61n, and 61g with 61a, all of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., in first paragraph, and incorporates section 61u as second paragraph.
Words “or agency thereof” and words “or any department or agency thereof” were inserted to remove any possible ambiguity as to scope of section. (See definitions of department and agency in section 6 of this title.)
Words “or by the District of Columbia or any agency or instrumentality thereof” were inserted upon authority of section 61n of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which provided that for the purposes of this section, “persons employed in the government of the District of Columbia shall be deemed to be employed in the executive branch of the Government of the United States.”
After “State” the words “Territory, or Possession of the United States” were inserted in two places upon authority of section 61s of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which defined “State,” as used in this section, as “any State, Territory, or possession of the United States.”
The punishment provision was derived from section 61g of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which, by reference, made this punishment applicable to this section.
The second paragraph was derived from section 61u of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which made its provisions applicable to this section by reference.
Changes were made in phraseology.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322, § 330016(1)(L), which directed the amendment of this section by substituting “under this title” for “not more than $10,000”, could not be executed because the phrase “not more than $10,000” does not appear in text.
Pub. L. 103–322, § 330016(1)(H), substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $1,000” in first par.
1970—Pub. L. 91–405 substituted reference to Delegate from District of Columbia or Resident Commissioner for Delegate or Resident Commissioner from any Territory or Possession.
