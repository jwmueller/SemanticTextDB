In subsection (c), the reference to the Fiscal Service [previously Division of Disbursement] in the Treasury Department is omitted as unnecessary.
In subsection (d), the amendment by section 3502(b) of Public Law 108–375, which struck the third sentence in 46 App. U.S.C. 1288 and inserted new material, was executed as if it were intended to strike the fourth sentence instead, to reflect probably [sic] intent.
The text of 46 App. U.S.C. 1288(b) is omitted as unnecessary because enactment of a law authorizing certain governmental functions is itself an authorization of appropriations to carry out those functions. The text of 46 App. U.S.C. 1288a is omitted as executed and impliedly repealed by 46 App. U.S.C. 1119.
