“SEC. 2. COMPLETION OF FIRE SAFETY RESEARCH.“(a) Center for Fire Research.—At the request of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the National Institute for Standards and Technology’s Center for Fire Research shall—“(1) develop a standard test method to determine cigarette ignition propensity,

“(2) compile performance data for cigarettes using the standard test method developed under paragraph (1), and

“(3) conduct laboratory studies on and computer modeling of ignition physics to develop valid, user-friendly predictive capability.


The Commission shall make such request not later than the expiration of 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Aug. 10, 1990].

“(b) Commission.—The Consumer Product Safety Commission shall—“(1) design and implement a study to collect baseline and followup data about the characteristics of cigarettes, products ignited, and smokers involved in fires, and

“(2) develop information on societal costs of cigarette-ignited fires.


“(c) Health and Human Services.—The Consumer Product Safety Commission, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall develop information on changes in the toxicity of smoke and resultant health effects from cigarette prototypes. The Commission shall not obligate more than $50,000 to develop such information.
