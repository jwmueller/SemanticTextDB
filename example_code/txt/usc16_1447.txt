Codification
This section and sections 438 to 440 of this title were derived from act Mar. 3, 1925, which was entitled “An act to repeal and reenact chapter 100, 1914, Public, Numbered 108, to provide for the restoration of Fort McHenry, in the State of Maryland, and its permanent preservation as a national park and perpetual national memorial shrine as the birthplace of the immortal ‘Star-Spangled Banner,’ written by Francis Scott Key, for the appropriation of the necessary funds, and for other purposes.” The enacting clause reads as follows: “Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That an Act authorizing the Secretary of War to grant the use of the Fort McHenry Military Reservation in the State of Maryland to the mayor and city council of Baltimore, a municipal corporation of the State of Maryland, making certain provisions in connection therewith, providing access to and from the site of the new immigration station heretofore set aside be, and hereby is, repealed and reenacted to read as follows:”.

As reenacted in 1925 this section recites that Fort McHenry is “now” occupied and used as a military reservation and authorized the restoration “so soon as it may no longer be needed for uses and needs growing out of the late war.” The foregoing provisions have been omitted as temporary.
The words of this section “on March 3, 1925” refer to the date of passage of the Act.
