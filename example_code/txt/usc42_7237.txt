References in TextSection 14116 of this title, referred to in subsec. (b)(1), was in the original “section 200203”, and was translated as reading “section 200207”, meaning section 200207 of Pub. L. 103–322, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because section 200203 of Pub. L. 103–322, which is classified to section 14112 of this title, does not provide for submission of applications, and section 14116 does so provide.
