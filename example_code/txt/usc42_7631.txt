§ 16154. Programs(a) In generalThe Secretary, in consultation with other Federal agencies and the private sector, shall conduct a research and development program on technologies relating to the production, purification, distribution, storage, and use of hydrogen energy, fuel cells, and related infrastructure.


(b) GoalThe goal of the program shall be to demonstrate and commercialize the use of hydrogen for transportation (in light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles), utility, industrial, commercial, and residential applications.


(c) FocusIn carrying out activities under this section, the Secretary shall focus on factors that are common to the development of hydrogen infrastructure and the supply of vehicle and electric power for critical consumer and commercial applications, and that achieve continuous technical evolution and cost reduction, particularly for hydrogen production, the supply of hydrogen, storage of hydrogen, and end uses of hydrogen that—(1) steadily increase production, distribution, and end use efficiency and reduce life-cycle emissions;

(2) resolve critical problems relating to catalysts, membranes, storage, lightweight materials, electronic controls, manufacturability, and other problems that emerge from the program;

(3) enhance sources of renewable fuels and biofuels for hydrogen production; and

(4) enable widespread use of distributed electricity generation and storage.


(d) Public education and researchIn carrying out this section, the Secretary shall support enhanced public education and research conducted at institutions of higher education in fundamental sciences, application design, and systems concepts (including education and research relating to materials, subsystems, manufacturability, maintenance, and safety) relating to hydrogen and fuel cells.

(7) the ability of domestic automobile manufacturers to manufacture commercially available competitive hybrid vehicle technologies in the United States.


(f) Program goals(1) VehiclesFor vehicles, the goals of the program are—(A) to enable a commitment by automakers no later than year 2015 to offer safe, affordable, and technically viable hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in the mass consumer market; and

(B) to enable production, delivery, and acceptance by consumers of model year 2020 hydrogen fuel cell and other hydrogen-powered vehicles that will have, when compared to light duty vehicles in model year 2005—(i) fuel economy that is substantially higher;

(ii) substantially lower emissions of air pollutants; and

(iii) equivalent or improved vehicle fuel system crash integrity and occupant protection.



(2) Hydrogen energy and energy infrastructureFor hydrogen energy and energy infrastructure, the goals of the program are to enable a commitment not later than 2015 that will lead to infrastructure by 2020 that will provide—(A) safe and convenient refueling;

(B) improved overall efficiency;

(C) widespread availability of hydrogen from domestic energy sources through—(i) production, with consideration of emissions levels;

(ii) delivery, including transmission by pipeline and other distribution methods for hydrogen; and

(iii) storage, including storage in surface transportation vehicles;


(D) hydrogen for fuel cells, internal combustion engines, and other energy conversion devices for portable, stationary, micro, critical needs facilities, and transportation applications; and

(E) other technologies consistent with the Department’s plan.


(3) Fuel cellsThe goals for fuel cells and their portable, stationary, and transportation applications are to enable—(A) safe, economical, and environmentally sound hydrogen fuel cells;

(B) fuel cells for light duty and other vehicles; and

(C) other technologies consistent with the Department’s plan.



(g) Funding(1) In generalThe Secretary shall carry out the programs under this section using a competitive, merit-based review process and consistent with the generally applicable Federal laws and regulations governing awards of financial assistance, contracts, or other agreements.


(2) Research centersActivities under this section may be carried out by funding nationally recognized university-based or Federal laboratory research centers.
