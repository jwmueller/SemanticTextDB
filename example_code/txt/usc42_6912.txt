References in TextSection 7587 of this title, referred to in subsec. (c), was in the original “section 247 of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990”, Pub. L. 101–549, and was translated as reading “section 247 of the Clean Air Act”, meaning section 247 of act July 14, 1955, ch. 360, title II, as added Nov. 15, 1990, Pub. L. 101–549, title II, § 229(a), 104 Stat. 2523, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 does not contain a section 247, and section 247 of the Clean Air Act relates to alternate fuel conversions for vehicles.
