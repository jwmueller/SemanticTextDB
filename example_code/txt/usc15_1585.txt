(C) in the case of a foreign government agency, such agency is not from a foreign state that the Secretary of State has determined, in accordance with section 2405(j) of the Appendix to title 50, has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, unless and until such determination is rescinded pursuant to section 2405(j)(4) of the Appendix to title 50.


(2) Abrogation of agreementsThe Commission may abrogate any agreement or memorandum of understanding with another agency if the Commission determines that the other agency has failed to maintain in confidence any information provided under such agreement or memorandum of understanding, or has used any such information for purposes other than those set forth in such agreement or memorandum of understanding.


(3) Additional rules against disclosureExcept as provided in paragraph (4), the Commission shall not be required to disclose under section 552 of title 5 or any other provision of law—(A) any material obtained from a foreign government agency, if the foreign government agency has requested confidential treatment, or has precluded such disclosure under other use limitations, as a condition of providing the material;
