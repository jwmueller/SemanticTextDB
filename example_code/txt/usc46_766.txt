In subsection (a), the text of 46 App. U.S.C. 808a is omitted as unnecessary. In paragraph (1), the words “owned by a citizen of the United States” are omitted as unnecessary because ownership by a citizen is a requirement for documentation. See section 12103 as revised by the bill.
In subsection (c), before paragraph (1), the words “Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, or any contract with the Secretary made under this subtitle or that Act” are substituted for “Notwithstanding subsection (c)(2) of this section, the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 [46 App. U.S.C. 1101 et seq.], or any contract entered into with the Secretary of Transportation under that Act” because the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, is restated principally in this subtitle, but other provisions of that Act are being neither restated nor repealed.


References in TextThe Merchant Marine Act, 1936, referred to in subsecs.
