A transfer of an interest in rail property under this chapter is exempt from a tax or levy related to the transfer that is imposed by the United States Government, a State, or a political subdivision of a State. On payment of the appropriate and generally applicable charge for the service performed, a transferee or transferor may record an instrument and, consistent with the final system plan, the release or removal of a pre-existing lien or encumbrance of record related to the interest transferred.
