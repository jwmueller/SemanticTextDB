“(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is coming to the United States pursuant to an adoption outside the United States, or for the purpose of adoption in the United States, is ineligible for admission under the Compact and the Compact, as amended. This subsection shall apply to any person who is or was an applicant for admission to the United States on or after March 1, 2003, including any applicant for admission in removal proceedings (including appellate proceedings) on or after March 1, 2003, regardless of the date such proceedings were commenced.

An unexpired Republic of the Marshall Islands passport with unexpired documentation issued by the Government of the United States evidencing admission under the Compact or the Compact, as amended, shall be considered to be documentation establishing identity and employment authorization under section 274A(b)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, 8 U.S.C. 1324a(b)(1)(B). The Government of the United States will take reasonable and appropriate steps to implement and publicize this provision, and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands will also take reasonable and appropriate steps to publicize this provision.

“(f) The Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, shall apply to any person admitted or seeking admission to the United States (other than a United States possession or territory where such Act does not apply) under the Compact or the Compact, as amended, and nothing in the Compact or the Compact, as amended, shall be construed to limit, preclude, or modify the applicability of, with respect to such person:“(1) any ground of inadmissibility or deportability under such Act (except sections 212(a)(5) and 212(a)(7)(B)(i)(II) of such Act, as provided in subsection (a) of this section), and any defense thereto, provided that, section 237(a)(5) of such Act shall be construed and applied as if it reads as follows: ‘any alien who has been admitted under the Compact, or the Compact, as amended, who cannot show that he or she has sufficient means of support in the United States, is deportable;’

“(2) the authority of the Government of the United States under section 214(a)(1) of such Act to provide that admission as a nonimmigrant shall be for such time and under such conditions as the Government of the United States may by regulations prescribe;

“(3) except for the treatment of certain documentation for purposes of section 274A(b)(1)(B) of such Act as provided by subsection (d) of this section of the Compact, as amended, any requirement under section 274A, including but not limited to section 274A(b)(1)(E);

“(g) Any authority possessed by the Government of the United States under this section of the Compact or the Compact, as amended, may also be exercised by the Government of a territory or possession of the United States where the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, does not apply, to the extent such exercise of authority is lawful under a statute or regulation of such territory or possession that is authorized by the laws of the United States.

“(h) Subsection (a) of this section does not confer on a citizen of the Republic of the Marshall Islands the right to establish the residence necessary for naturalization under the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, or to petition for benefits for alien relatives under that Act. Subsection (a) of this section, however, shall not prevent a citizen of the Republic of the Marshall Islands from otherwise acquiring such rights or lawful permanent resident alien status in the United States.
