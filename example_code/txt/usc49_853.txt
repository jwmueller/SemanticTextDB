“SEC. 103. SPECIAL RULES FOR COMPENSATION.“(a) Documentation.—Subject to subsection (b), the amount of compensation payable to an air carrier under section 101(a)(2) may not exceed the amount of losses described in section 101(a)(2) that the air carrier demonstrates to the satisfaction of the President, using sworn financial statements or other appropriate data, that the air carrier incurred. The Secretary of Transportation and the Comptroller General of the United States may audit such statements and may request any information that the Secretary and the Comptroller General deems necessary to conduct such audit.

“(b) Maximum Amount of Compensation Payable Per Air Carrier.—The maximum total amount of compensation payable to an air carrier under section 101(a)(2) may not exceed the lesser of—“(1) the amount of such air carrier’s direct and incremental losses described in section 101(a)(2); or

“(2) in the case of—“(A) flights involving passenger-only or combined passenger and cargo transportation, the product of—“(i) $4,500,000,000; and

“(ii) the ratio of—     “(I) the available seat miles of the air carrier for the month of August 2001 as reported to the Secretary; to

     “(II) the total available seat miles of all such air carriers for such month as reported to the Secretary; and



“(B) flights involving cargo-only transportation, the product of—“(i) $500,000,000; and

“(ii) the ratio of—     “(I) the revenue ton miles or other auditable measure of the air carrier for cargo for the latest quarter for which data is available as reported to the Secretary; to

     “(II) the total revenue ton miles or other auditable measure of all such air carriers for cargo for such quarter as reported to the Secretary.





“(c) Payments.—The President may provide compensation to air carriers under section 101(a)(2) in 1 or more payments up to the amount authorized by this title.

“(d) Compensation for Certain Air Carriers.—“(1) Set-aside.—The President may set aside a portion of the amount of compensation payable to air carriers under section 101(a)(2) to provide compensation to classes of air carriers, such as air tour operators and air ambulances (including hospitals operating air ambulances) for whom the application of a distribution formula containing available seat miles as a factor would inadequately reflect their share of direct and incremental losses. The President shall reduce the $4,500,000,000 specified in subsection (b)(2)(A)(i) by the amount set aside under this subsection.

“(2) Distribution of amounts.—The President shall distribute the amount set aside under this subsection proportionally among such air carriers based on an appropriate auditable measure, as determined by the President.
