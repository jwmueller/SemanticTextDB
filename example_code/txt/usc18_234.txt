L. 103–94, § 4(b), Oct. 6, 1993, 107 Stat. 1005; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(K), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147; Pub. L. 109–435, title VI, § 604(f), Dec. 20, 2006, 120 Stat. 3242.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 209, 212 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §§ 119, 122, 35 Stat. 1110).
This section consolidates sections 209 and 212 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., without change of substance.
To eliminate ambiguity resulting from use of identical words in reference “officer or employee of the United States mentioned in section 208 of this title” as those appearing in section 208 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., now section 602 of this title, words “person mentioned in section 602 of this title” were inserted.
Words “from any such person” were inserted after “purpose”, so as to make it clear that the section does not embrace State employees in its provisions. Some Federal agencies are located in State buildings occupied by State employees.
The punishment provision was derived from section 212 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. (See reviser’s note under section 602 of this title.)
Minor changes were made in phraseology.
