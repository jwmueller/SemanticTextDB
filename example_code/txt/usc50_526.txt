“(2) the President, acting through the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations, should seek to end the veto power of the Government of Sudan over the plans by OLS for air transport relief flights and, by doing so, to end the manipulation of the delivery of relief supplies to the advantage of the Government of Sudan on the battlefield; and

“(3) the President should take appropriate measures, including the implementation of recommendations of the International Eminent Persons Commission contained in the report issued on May 22, 2002, to end slavery and aerial bombardment of civilians by the Government of Sudan.
