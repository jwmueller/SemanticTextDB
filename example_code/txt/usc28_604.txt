§ 1861. Declaration of policy
It is the policy of the United States that all litigants in Federal courts entitled to trial by jury shall have the right to grand and petit juries selected at random from a fair cross section of the community in the district or division wherein the court convenes. It is further the policy of the United States that all citizens shall have the opportunity to be considered for service on grand and petit juries in the district courts of the United States, and shall have an obligation to serve as jurors when summoned for that purpose.
(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 951; Pub. L. 85–315, part V, § 152, Sept. 9, 1957, 71 Stat. 638; Pub. L. 90–274, § 101, Mar. 27, 1968, 82 Stat. 54.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 411 and 415 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§ 275, 278, 38 Stat. 1164, 1165).
The revised section prescribes uniform standards of qualification for jurors in Federal Courts instead of making qualifications depend upon State laws. This is in accord with proposed legislation recommended by the Judicial Conference of the United States.
The last paragraph is added to exclude jurors incompetent to serve as jurors in State courts.

Amendments1968—Pub. L. 90–274 substituted provisions declaring the policy of the United States with respect to trial by jury and the opportunity to serve on such juries for provisions setting out the required qualifications of Federal jurors, including age, citizenship, residence, freedom from conviction of certain crimes, ability to read, write, speak, and understand the English language, and capability of rendering efficient jury service.
1957—Pub. L. 85–315 substituted “Qualifications of Federal jurors” for “Qualifications” in section catchline.
Pub. L. 85–315 substituted “and who has resided for a period of one year within the judicial district” for “and resides within the judicial district”, and struck out provisions which prohibited service as a grand or petit juror if a person was incompetent to serve as a grand or petit juror by the law of the State in which the district court is held.
