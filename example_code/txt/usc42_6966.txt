§ 13362. Innovative clean coal technology transfer program(a) Establishment of programThe Secretary, through the Agency for International Development, and in consultation with the other members of the CCT Subgroup, shall establish a clean coal technology transfer program to carry out the purposes described in subsection (b) of this section. Within 150 days after October 24, 1992, the Secretary and the Administrator of the Agency for International Development shall enter into a written agreement to carry out this section. The agreement shall establish a procedure for resolving any disputes between the Secretary and the Administrator regarding the implementation of specific projects. With respect to countries not assisted by the Agency for International Development, the Secretary may enter into agreements with other appropriate United States agencies. If the Secretary and the Administrator, or the Secretary and an agency described in the previous sentence, are unable to reach an agreement, each shall send a memorandum to the President outlining an appropriate agreement. Within 90 days after receipt of either memorandum, the President shall determine which version of the agreement shall be in effect. Any agreement entered into under this subsection shall be provided to the appropriate committees of the Congress and made available to the public.


(b) Purposes of programThe purposes of the technology transfer program under this section are to—(1) reduce the United States balance of trade deficit through the export of United States energy technologies and technological expertise;

(2) retain and create manufacturing and related service jobs in the United States;

(3) encourage the export of United States technologies, including services related thereto, to those countries that have a need for developmentally sound facilities to provide energy derived from coal resources;

(4) develop markets for United States technologies and, where appropriate, United States coal resources to be utilized in meeting the energy and environmental requirements of foreign countries;

(5) better ensure that United States participation in energy-related projects in foreign countries includes participation by United States firms as well as utilization of United States technologies that have been developed or demonstrated in the United States through publicly or privately funded demonstration programs;

(6) provide for the accelerated deployment of United States technologies that will serve to introduce into foreign countries United States technologies intended to use coal resources in a more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally acceptable manner;

(7) serve to ensure the introduction of United States firms and expertise in foreign countries;

(8) provide financial assistance by the Federal Government to foster greater participation by United States firms in the financing, ownership, design, construction, or operation of clean coal technology projects in foreign countries;

(9) assist foreign countries in meeting their energy needs through the use of coal in an environmentally acceptable manner, consistent with sustainable development policies; and

(10) assist United States firms, especially firms that are in competition with firms in foreign countries, to obtain opportunities to transfer technologies to, or undertake projects in, foreign countries.

(iii) such other forms of financial assistance as the Secretary, through the Agency for International Development, considers appropriate.



(2) The financial assistance authorized by this section may be—(A) provided in combination with other forms of financial assistance, including non-United States funding that is available to the project; and

(3) United States obligations under the Arrangement on Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits established through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development shall be applicable to this section.


(e) Solicitations for project proposals(1) Pursuant to the agreements under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary, through the Agency for International Development, within one year after October 24, 1992, and subsequently as appropriate thereafter, shall solicit proposals from United States firms for the design, construction, testing, and operation of the project or projects identified under subsection (c) of this section which propose to utilize a United States technology. Each solicitation under this section shall establish a closing date for receipt of proposals.

(2) The solicitation under this subsection shall, to the extent appropriate, be modeled after the RFP No. DE–PS01–90FE62271 Clean Coal Technology IV as administered by the Department of Energy.

(3) Any solicitation made under this subsection shall include the following requirements:(A) The United States firm that submits a proposal in response to the solicitation shall have an equity interest in the proposed project.

(B) The project shall utilize a United States clean coal technology, including services related thereto, and, where appropriate, United States coal resources, in meeting the applicable energy and environmental requirements of the host country.

(C) Proposals for projects shall be submitted by and undertaken with a United States firm, although a joint venture or other teaming arrangement with a non-United States manufacturer or other non-United States entity is permissible.



(f) Assistance to United States firmsPursuant to the agreements under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary, through the Agency for International Development, and in consultation with the CCT Subgroup, shall establish a procedure to provide financial assistance to United States firms under this section for a project identified under subsection (c) of this section where solicitations for the project are being conducted by the host country or by a multilateral lending institution.
