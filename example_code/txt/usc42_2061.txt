(ii) the projected per capita expenditures under the State child health plan (as determined under subparagraph (C) for the fiscal year), multiplied by the enhanced FMAP (as defined in section 1397ee(b) of this title) for the State and fiscal year involved (or in which the period occurs).


(B) Target average number of child enrolleesIn this paragraph, the target average number of child enrollees for a State—(i) for fiscal year 2009 is equal to the monthly average unduplicated number of children enrolled in the State child health plan under this subchapter (including such children receiving health care coverage through funds under this subchapter pursuant to a waiver under section 1315 of this title) during fiscal year 2008 increased by the population growth for children in that State for the year ending on June 30, 2007 (as estimated by the Bureau of the Census) plus 1 percentage point; or

(ii) for a subsequent fiscal year (or semi-annual period occurring in a fiscal year) is equal to the target average number of child enrollees for the State for the previous fiscal year increased by the child population growth factor described in subsection (m)(5)(B) for the State for the prior fiscal year.


(C) Projected per capita expendituresFor purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii), the projected per capita expenditures under a State child health plan—(i) for fiscal year 2009 is equal to the average per capita expenditures (including both State and Federal financial participation) under such plan for the targeted low-income children counted in the average monthly caseload for purposes of this paragraph during fiscal year 2008, increased by the annual percentage increase in the projected per capita amount of National Health Expenditures (as estimated by the Secretary) for 2009; or

(ii) for a subsequent fiscal year (or semi-annual period occurring in a fiscal year) is equal to the projected per capita expenditures under such plan for the previous fiscal year (as determined under clause (i) or this clause) increased by the annual percentage increase in the projected per capita amount of National Health Expenditures (as estimated by the Secretary) for the year in which such subsequent fiscal year ends.


(D) Proration ruleIf the amounts available for payment from the Fund for a fiscal year or period are less than the total amount of payments determined under subparagraph (A) for the fiscal year or period, the amount to be paid under such subparagraph to each eligible State shall be reduced proportionally.


(E) Timely payment; reconciliationPayment under this paragraph for a fiscal year or period shall be made before the end of the fiscal year or period based upon the most recent data for expenditures and enrollment and the provisions of subsection (e) of section 1397ee of this title shall apply to payments under this subsection in the same manner as they apply to payments under such section.


(F) Continued reportingFor purposes of this paragraph and subsection (f), the State shall submit to the Secretary the State’s projected Federal expenditures, even if the amount of such expenditures exceeds the total amount of allotments available to the State in such fiscal year or period.


(G) Application to commonwealths and territoriesNo payment shall be made under this paragraph to a commonwealth or territory described in subsection (c)(3) until such time as the Secretary determines that there are in effect methods, satisfactory to the Secretary, for the collection and reporting of reliable data regarding the enrollment of children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) in order to accurately determine the commonwealth’s or territory’s eligibility for, and amount of payment, under this paragraph.
