§ 7294. Suspension of construction in case of treaty
In case of a treaty for the limitation of naval armament to which the United States is a signatory, the President may suspend so much of the authorized naval construction as is necessary to bring the naval vessels of the United States within the limitations agreed upon. Such a suspension does not apply to vessels under construction at the time the suspension is made.
(Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 449.)

The words “the United States would welcome and support an international conference for naval limitations” are omitted as a declaration of purpose without permanent or general significance. The word “further” is omitted since there is no such agreement in existence today. The word “international” is omitted as unnecessary since the word “treaty” necessarily involves an international understanding. The word “may” is substituted for the words “is hereby authorized and empowered to” for brevity.
