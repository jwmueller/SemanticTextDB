Historical and Revision Notes
1948 ActBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 413, 415, 418, 418a, 419 (May 22, 1934, ch. 333, §§ 1, 3, 6, 48 Stat. 794, 795; May 22, 1934, ch. 333, § 7, as added Aug. 3, 1939, ch. 413, § 5, 53 Stat. 1179; May 22, 1934, ch. 333, § 7, renumbered § 8 by Aug. 3, 1939, ch. 413, § 6, 53 Stat. 1179; Aug. 3, 1939, ch. 413, §§ 1, 4, 5, 53 Stat. 1178, 1179).
Section consolidates sections 413, 415, 417, 418, 418a, and 419 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
Words “or with intent to steal or purloin, knowing the same to have been so stolen, converted, or taken” were omitted as surplusage, since property so “taken” is “stolen,” and insertion of word “knowingly” after “Whoever” at beginning of section renders such omission possible.
Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “principal” in section 2 of this title.
Section 413 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., providing the short title “National Stolen Property Act,” was omitted as not appropriate in a revision.
Section 414 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., containing definitions of “interstate or foreign commerce,” “securities,” and “money,” is incorporated in sections 10 and 2311 of this title.
Section 417 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to indictments and determination of “value” of goods, wares, merchandise, securities, and money referred to in indictments, is also incorporated in section 2311 of this title.
Section 418 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to venue, was omitted as completely covered by section 3237 of this title.
Section 418a of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to conspiracy, was omitted as covered by section 371 of this title, the general conspiracy section.
Section 419 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., providing that nothing contained in the National Stolen Property Act should be construed to repeal, modify, or amend any part of the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act, was omitted as unnecessary, in view of this revision and reenactment of the provisions of the latter act (sections 10, 2311–2313 of this title).
Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.
