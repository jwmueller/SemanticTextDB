Section 2113 provides the Secretary with the authority to exempt certain vessels from the inspection and manning requirements of law when vessels are engaged in excursions or oceanographic research. This is the authority of the issuance of excursion permits when special circumstances justify the waiver of certain maritime safety and seamen’s welfare laws for a short period of time. It also contains flexible exemption authority for regulation of oceanographic research vessels.
