(2) the rate of hire the Secretary considers just compensation for the use of the vessel and the services required under the charter.

5630246 App.:1242(c) (1st sentence).June 29, 1936, ch. 858, title IX, § 902(c) (1st sentence); as added Aug. 7, 1939, ch. 555, § 3, 53 Stat. 1255; Pub. L. 97–31, § 12(131), Aug. 6, 1981, 95 Stat. 165.


In subsection (a), the words “requisitioned for use but not ownership under this chapter” are substituted for “taken and used under authority of this section, but the ownership thereof is not required by the United States” to eliminate unnecessary words. The word “requisition” is substituted for “taking”, and the word “vessel” is substituted for “such property”, for consistency.
Subsection (b) is added because the provisions about disputed compensation, for both charter use and other takings, are consolidated in section 56304 of the revised title to avoid repetition.
