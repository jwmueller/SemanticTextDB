The penalty shall be in addition to any other available civil remedy or any available criminal penalty and may be imposed whether or not the Secretary imposes other administrative sanctions.


(2) Amount of penaltyThe amount of the penalty, as determined by the Secretary, may not exceed $5,000 for each violation, except that the maximum penalty for all violations by a particular issuer or custodian during any one-year period shall not exceed $1,000,000. Each violation of a provision of subsection (b)(1) shall constitute a separate violation with respect to each pool of mortgages. In the case of a continuing violation, as determined by the Secretary, each day shall constitute a separate violation.



(b) Violations for which penalty may be imposed(1) ViolationsThe violations by an issuer or a custodian for which the Secretary may impose a civil money penalty under subsection (a) are the following:(A) Failure to make timely payments of principal and interest to holders of securities guaranteed under section 1721(g) of this title.

(C) may provide for review by the Secretary of any determination or order, or interlocutory ruling, arising from a hearing.


(2) Final ordersIf no hearing is requested within 15 days of receipt of a notice of opportunity for hearing, the imposition of a penalty shall constitute a final and unappealable determination. If the Secretary reviews the determination or order, the Secretary may affirm, modify, or reverse that determination or order. If the Secretary does not review the determination or order within 90 days of the issuance of the determination or order, the determination or order shall be final.


(3) Factors in determining amount of penaltyIn determining the amount of a penalty under subsection (a), consideration shall be given to such factors as the gravity of the offense, any history of prior offenses (including offenses occurring before December 15, 1989), ability to pay the penalty, injury to the public, benefits received, deterrence of future violations, and such other factors as the Secretary may determine by regulations.


(4) Reviewability of imposition of penaltyThe Secretary’s determination or order imposing a penalty under subsection (a) shall not be subject to review, except as provided in subsection (d).



(d) Judicial review of agency determination(1) In generalAfter exhausting all administrative remedies established by the Secretary under subsection (c)(1), an issuer or a custodian against which the Secretary has imposed a civil money penalty under subsection (a) may obtain a review of the penalty and such ancillary issues as may be addressed in the notice provided under subsection (c)(1)(A) in the appropriate court of appeals of the United States, by filing in such court, within 20 days after the entry of such order or determination, a written petition praying that the Secretary’s order or determination be modified or be set aside in whole or in part.


(2) Objections not raised in hearingA court shall not consider any objection that was not raised in the hearing conducted pursuant to subsection (c)(1) unless a demonstration is made of extraordinary circumstances causing the failure to raise the objection.

(3) Scope of reviewThe decisions, findings, and determinations of the Secretary shall be reviewed pursuant to section 706 of title 5.


(4) Order to pay penaltyNotwithstanding any other provision of law, the court shall have the power in any such review to order payment of the penalty imposed by the Secretary.

The monetary judgment may, in the discretion of the court, include any attorneys fees and other expenses incurred by the United States in connection with the action. In an action under this subsection, the validity and appropriateness of the Secretary’s determination or order imposing the penalty shall not be subject to review.


(f) Settlement by SecretaryThe Secretary may compromise, modify, or remit any civil money penalty which may be, or has been, imposed under this section.
