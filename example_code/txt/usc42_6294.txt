References in TextSection 10504 of this title, referred to in subsec. (a), was in the original a reference to “section 554”, and was translated as if it had been a reference to section 609P of Pub. L. 98–473, which is classified to section 10504 of this title to reflect the probable intent of Congress as manifested in earlier versions of Emergency Federal Law Enforcement Assistance provisions introduced in the Congress. Pub. L. 98–473 does not contain a section 554.
