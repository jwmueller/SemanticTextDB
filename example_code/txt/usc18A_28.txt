“Disclosure otherwise prohibited by this rule of matters occurring before the grand jury may also be made—“(i) when so directed by a court preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding;

“(ii) when permitted by a court at the request of the defendant, upon a showing that grounds may exist for a motion to dismiss the indictment because of matters occurring before the grand jury;

“(iii) when the disclosure is made by an attorney for the government to another federal grand jury; or

“(iv) when permitted by a court at the request of an attorney for the government, upon a showing that such matters may disclose a violation of state criminal law, to an appropriate official of a state or subdivision of a state for the purpose of enforcing such law.


If the court orders disclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury, the disclosure shall be made in such manner, at such time, and under such conditions as the court may direct.”
