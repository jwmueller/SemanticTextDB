(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 751; Pub. L. 90–19, § 24(c), May 25, 1967, 81 Stat. 28; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(K), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 1731(a) of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking (June 27, 1934, ch. 847, § 512(a), 48 Stat. 1265; Feb. 3, 1938, ch. 13, § 9, 52 Stat. 24).
Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “principal” in section 2 of this title.
“$5,000” was substituted for “$3,000” to make this section more consistent in its punishment provisions with comparable sections. (See section 1008 of this title.)
Minor changes in phraseology were made.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000”.
1967—Pub. L. 90–19 included reference to Department of Housing and Urban Development in section catchline and substituted in text “Department of Housing and Urban Development” for “Federal Housing Administration” and “Department” for “Administration” in two places, respectively.
