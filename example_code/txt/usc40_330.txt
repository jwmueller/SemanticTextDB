The provisions of section 1812 of the Revised Statues [sic] which authorized the Chief of Engineers, as Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds, to report to the Secretary of War concerning the Chief of Engineers’ operations for the preceding year, including an account of the manner in which all appropriations for public buildings and grounds had been applied, are omitted because the Office of Public Buildings and Grounds under the Chief of Engineers was abolished and the functions of the Chief of Engineers and the Secretary of War with respect to the Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds were transferred to the Director of Public Buildings and Public Parks of the National Capital by section 3 of the Act of February 26, 1925 (ch. 339, 43 Stat. 983). Those functions subsequently were transferred to the National Park Service by section 2 of Executive Order No. 6166 (eff. June 10, 1933) and the Act of March 2, 1934 (ch. 38, 48 Stat. 389), the Public Buildings Administrator in the Federal Works Agency by sections 301 and 303 of Reorganization Plan No. I of 1939 (eff. July 1, 1939, 53 Stat. 1426, 1427), and the Administrator of General Services by section 103(a) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, 63 Stat. 380), which is restated as section 303(c) [303(b)] of the revised title. The words “Secretary of the Army” are substituted for “Department of War” [subsequently changed to “Department of the Army” because of section 205(a) of the National Security Act of 1947 (ch. 343, 61 Stat. 501)] because of 10:3013(a)(1).
