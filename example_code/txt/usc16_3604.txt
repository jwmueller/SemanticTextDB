“Sec. 5. [Appraisals and Reappraisals of Value]. The appraised values referred to in section 3 of this Act shall be determined from time to time for a period of five years after the date of this Act [Aug. 30, 1957] by the Administrator of Housing and Home Finance Agency or his designee at the request of the Secretary. Thereafter, the Secretary may make such reappraisals as he deems necessary. Appraisals or reappraisals in the town area shall be made only after representatives of the Coulee Dam community, as determined by the Secretary, and of the Columbia River Commission, or such corresponding organization as may succeed it, have been granted an opportunity to offer advice. All appraisals and reappraisals shall be made on the basis of the properties’ fair market value in the locality. In the sale of property to a tenant under subsections 3(b)(1) and (3)(d)(1) of this Act, the value of structural improvements made at such tenant’s own expense shall, to the extent the appraiser or appraisers hereunder determine that such improvements actually enhance the value of the property, be deducted from what would otherwise be the appraised value of the property to be sold; and the difference shall be deemed the appraised value for the purposes of this Act.
