§ 41714. Availability of slots(a) Making Slots Available for Essential Air Service.—(1) Operational authority.—If basic essential air service under subchapter II of this chapter is to be provided from an eligible point to a high density airport (other than Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport), the Secretary of Transportation shall ensure that the air carrier providing or selected to provide such service has sufficient operational authority at the high density airport to provide such service. The operational authority shall allow flights at reasonable times taking into account the needs of passengers with connecting flights.

(2) Exemptions.—If necessary to carry out the objectives of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall by order grant exemptions from the requirements of subparts K and S of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (pertaining to slots at high density airports), to air carriers using Stage 3 aircraft or to commuter air carriers, unless such an exemption would significantly increase operational delays.

(3) Assurance of access.—If the Secretary finds that an exemption under paragraph (2) would significantly increase operational delays, the Secretary shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure that an air carrier providing or selected to provide basic essential air service is able to obtain access to a high density airport.

(4) Action by the secretary.—The Secretary shall issue a final order under this subsection on or before the 60th day after receiving a request from an air carrier for operational authority under this subsection.


(b) Slots for Foreign Air Transportation.—(1) Exemptions.—If the Secretary finds it to be in the public interest at a high density airport (other than Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport), the Secretary may grant by order exemptions from the requirements of subparts K and S of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (pertaining to slots at high density airports), to enable air carriers and foreign air carriers to provide foreign air transportation using Stage 3 aircraft.

(2) Slot withdrawals.—The Secretary may not withdraw a slot at Chicago O’Hare International Airport from an air carrier in order to allocate that slot to a carrier to provide foreign air transportation.

(3) Equivalent rights of access.—The Secretary shall not take a slot at a high density airport from an air carrier and award such slot to a foreign air carrier if the Secretary determines that air carriers are not provided equivalent rights of access to airports in the country of which such foreign air carrier is a citizen.

(4) Conversions of slots.—Effective May 1, 2000, slots at Chicago O’Hare International Airport allocated to an air carrier as of November 1, 1999, to provide foreign air transportation shall be made available to such carrier to provide interstate or intrastate air transportation.


(c) Slots for New Entrants.—If the Secretary finds it to be in the public interest, the Secretary may by order grant exemptions from the requirements under subparts K and S of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (pertaining to slots at high density airports), to enable new entrant air carriers to provide air transportation at high density airports (other than Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport).

(d) Special Rules for Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.—(1) In general.—Notwithstanding sections 49104(a)(5) and 49111(e) of this title, or any provision of this section, the Secretary may, only under circumstances determined by the Secretary to be exceptional, grant by order to an air carrier currently holding or operating a slot at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport an exemption from requirements under subparts K and S of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (pertaining to slots at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport), to enable that carrier to provide air transportation with Stage 3 aircraft at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport; except that such exemption shall not—(A) result in an increase in the total number of slots per day at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport;

(B) result in an increase in the total number of slots at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport from 7:00 ante meridiem to 9:59 post meridiem;

(C) increase the number of operations at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in any 1-hour period by more than 2 operations;

(D) result in the withdrawal or reduction of slots operated by an air carrier;

(E) result in a net increase in noise impact on surrounding communities resulting from changes in timing of operations permitted under this subsection; and

(F) continue in effect on or after the date on which the final rules issued under subsection (f) become effective.


(2) Limitation on applicability.—Nothing in this subsection shall adversely affect Exemption No. 5133, as from time-to-time amended and extended.


(e) Study.—(1) Matters to be considered.—The Secretary shall continue the Secretary’s current examination of slot regulations and shall ensure that the examination includes consideration of—(A) whether improvements in technology and procedures of the air traffic control system and the use of quieter aircraft make it possible to eliminate the limitations on hourly operations imposed by the high density rule contained in part 93 of title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations or to increase the number of operations permitted under such rule;

(B) the effects of the elimination of limitations or an increase in the number of operations allowed on each of the following:(i) congestion and delay in any part of the national aviation system;

(ii) the impact of noise on persons living near the airport;

(iii) competition in the air transportation system;

(iv) the profitability of operations of airlines serving the airport; and

(v) aviation safety;


(C) the impact of the current slot allocation process upon the ability of air carriers to provide essential air service under subchapter II of this chapter;

(D) the impact of such allocation process upon the ability of new entrant air carriers to obtain slots in time periods that enable them to provide service;

(E) the impact of such allocation process on the ability of foreign air carriers to obtain slots;

(F) the fairness of such process to air carriers and the extent to which air carriers are provided equivalent rights of access to the air transportation market in the countries of which foreign air carriers holding slots are citizens;

(G) the impact, on the ability of air carriers to provide domestic and international air service, of the withdrawal of slots from air carriers in order to provide slots for foreign air carriers; and

(H) the impact of the prohibition on slot withdrawals in subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section on the aviation relationship between the United States Government and foreign governments, including whether the prohibition in such subsections will require the withdrawal of slots from general and military aviation in order to meet the needs of air carriers and foreign air carriers providing foreign air transportation (and the impact of such withdrawal on general aviation and military aviation) and whether slots will become available to meet the needs of air carriers and foreign air carriers to provide foreign air transportation as a result of the planned relocation of Air Force Reserve units and the Air National Guard at O’Hare International Airport.


(2) Report.—Not later than January 31, 1995, the Secretary shall complete the current examination of slot regulations and shall transmit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives a report containing the results of such examination.
