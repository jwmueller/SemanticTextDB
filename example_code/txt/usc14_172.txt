§ 369. Inclusion of certain conditions in enlistment contract
The enlistment contract shall contain the substance of sections 365 to 368, inclusive, of this title.
(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 524.)

Historical and Revision NotesIt is believed desirable to have the provisions specified included in the enlistment contract, as they include certain privileges and obligations that any man should clearly understand before enlisting. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.
