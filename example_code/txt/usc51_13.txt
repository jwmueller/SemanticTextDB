In subsections (a)(2) and (b), the words “section 102(c) of this Act”, which appear in section 206 of Public Law 85–568 (72 Stat. 432), are treated as referring to section 102(d), rather than section 102(c), of Public Law 85–568 because of the redesignation done by section 110(a)(2) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act, 1985 (Public Law 98–361, 98 Stat. 426). Section 102(d) of Public Law 85–568 is restated as section 20102(d) of title 51.
