“Sec. 57. [Retirement or Adjustment of Outstanding Mortgage Obligation.] For the purpose of enabling the State of Alaska to retire or adjust outstanding home mortgage obligations or other real property liens secured by one to four family homes which were severely damaged or destroyed in the March 1964 earthquake and subsequent seismic waves, the President is authorized to make additional grants to the State of Alaska in an amount not to exceed a total of $5,500,000 to match, on a fifty-fifty basis, any funds provided by the State to pay the costs of retiring or adjusting such mortgage obligations. In order to be approved, a State application for a grant for carrying out the purpose of this section must: (1) be in accordance with a plan submitted by the State, to be approved by the President, for the implementation of the purpose of this section; (2) designate the State agency for retiring or adjusting said mortgage obligations; (3) provide that the mortgagor shall be required to absorb the damage loss to the entire extent of his equity interest in the property and also agree to pay at least $1,000 of the outstanding mortgage balance; (4) provide that no payments for retiring or adjusting mortgage obligations on a single property shall exceed $30,000; (5) provide regulations to assure equitable treatment among home owners and to prevent unjustified payments or gains to the State, mortgagees or mortgagors; and (6) provide that the State agency will make such reports, in such form and containing such information as the President may from time to time require, and give the President, upon demand, access to the records on which such reports are based.”
