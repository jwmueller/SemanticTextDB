However, the amendment was executed to section 8G(a)(2) of the Inspector General Act of 1978 relating to requirements for Federal entities and designated Federal entities, to reflect the probable intent of Congress and the successive renumbering of that section as section 8F by Pub. L. 103–82 and as section 8G by Pub. L. 103–204.
