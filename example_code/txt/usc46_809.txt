In subsection (a), the words “if the Secretary considers the charter hire offered too low” are substituted for “if, in the Secretary’s discretion, the charter hire offered is deemed too low” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “lacks the qualifications required by section 57514 of this title” are substituted for “lacks sufficient capital, credit, or experience to operate successfully the line” to avoid repeating the qualifications in more than one place.
