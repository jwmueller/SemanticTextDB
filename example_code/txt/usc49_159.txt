The Secretary may not regulate the rates, fares, tolls, rentals, or other charges prescribed by any provider of public transportation.

(2) Limitation on statutory construction.—Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent the Secretary from requiring a recipient of funds under this chapter to comply with the terms and conditions of its Federal assistance agreement.


(c) Procedures for Prescribing Regulations.—(1) The Secretary shall prepare an agenda listing all areas in which the Secretary intends to propose regulations governing activities under this chapter within the following 12 months.

(2) Except for emergency regulations, the Secretary shall give interested parties at least 60 days to participate in a regulatory proceeding under this chapter by submitting written information, views, or arguments, with or without an oral presentation, except when the Secretary for good cause finds that public notice and comment are unnecessary because of the routine nature or insignificant impact of the regulation or that an emergency regulation should be issued.

(2) impair the civil rights, under the laws of a State or political subdivision of a State, of an inhabitant of the property.


(h) Transfer of Assets No Longer Needed.—(1) If a recipient of assistance under this chapter decides an asset acquired under this chapter at least in part with that assistance is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was acquired, the Secretary may authorize the recipient to transfer the asset to a local governmental authority to be used for a public purpose with no further obligation to the Government.

(B) there is no purpose eligible for assistance under this chapter for which the asset should be used;

(C) the overall benefit of allowing the transfer is greater than the interest of the Government in liquidation and return of the financial interest of the Government in the asset, after considering fair market value and other factors; and

(D) through an appropriate screening or survey process, that there is no interest in acquiring the asset for Government use if the asset is a facility or land.


(2) A decision under paragraph (1) must be in writing and include the reason for the decision.

(3) This subsection is in addition to any other law related to using and disposing of a facility or equipment under an assistance agreement.

(4) Proceeds from the sale of transit assets.—(A) In general.—When real property, equipment, or supplies acquired with assistance under this chapter are no longer needed for public transportation purposes as determined under the applicable assistance agreement, the Secretary may authorize the sale, transfer, or lease of the assets under conditions determined by the Secretary and subject to the requirements of this subsection.

(B) Use.—The net income from asset sales, uses, or leases (including lease renewals) under this subsection shall be used by the recipient to reduce the gross project cost of other capital projects carried out under this chapter.

(C) Relationship to other authority.—The authority of the Secretary under this subsection is in addition to existing authorities controlling allocation or use of recipient income otherwise permissible in law or regulation in effect prior to the date of enactment of this paragraph.



(i) Transfer of Amounts and Non-Government Share.—(1) Amounts made available for a public transportation project under title 23 may be transferred to and administered by the Secretary under this chapter.

In subsections (c)–(f), and (j), the relevant substantive provisions of 12:1749a are substituted for “shall . . . have the functions, powers, and duties set forth in section 1749a of title 12, except subsections (c)(2) and (f) of such section” for clarity. The reference to subsection (c)(2) is omitted as obsolete because section 201(d)(1) of the Housing and Community Development Technical Amendments Act of 1984 (Public Law 98–479, 98 Stat. 2228) repealed 12:1749a(c)(2). The words “(in addition to any authority otherwise vested in him)” are omitted as surplus.
In subsection (a), the text of 49 App.:1608(a) (1st sentence related to 12:1749a(c)(8)) is omitted as obsolete. Before clause (1), the words “carrying out this chapter” are substituted for “the performance of, and with respect to, the functions, powers, and duties vested in him by this chapter” to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (1), the words “(except terms the Secretary of Labor prescribes under section 5333(b) of this title)” are added for clarity because 49 App.:1608(a) only applies to the Secretary of Transportation and does not supersede the responsibility of the Secretary of Labor. In clause (3), the word “civil” is added for clarity. The words “contract, or other” are omitted as surplus. In clause (4), the words “bid for and . . . at any foreclosure or any other sale” are omitted as surplus. In clause (6), the words “at public or private sale”, “real or personal”, and “upon such terms as he may fix” are omitted as surplus. Clause (8) is substituted for 49 App.:1608(a) (1st sentence related to 12:1749a(c)(7)) to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (9), the word “provisions” is omitted as surplus. The words “carry out this chapter” are substituted for “assure that the purposes of this subchapter will be achieved” to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsection (b), the words “regulatory” and “regulatory proceeding” are substituted for “rulemaking” for consistency in the revised title and because “rule” and “regulation” are synonymous.
In subsection (b)(1), the words “Federal Transit Administration” are substituted for “Urban Mass Transportation Administration” because of section 3004(b) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Public Law 102–240, 105 Stat. 2088). The words “also” and “required by the first sentence of this paragraph” are omitted as surplus.
In subsection (c), before clause (1), the words “In the performance of, and with respect to, the functions, powers, and duties vested in him by this subchapter . . . notwithstanding the provisions of any other law” are omitted as surplus. In clause (1), the words “prepare . . . and” and “for wholly owned Government corporations” are omitted as surplus.
Subsection (d) is substituted for 49 App.:1608(a) (1st sentence related to 12:1749a(b) and last sentence) to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsection (e), the words “such . . . as the making of loans” are omitted as surplus. The words “under this chapter” are added for clarity. The word “related” is substituted for “in connection with such financial transactions” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “approved by the Secretary” are omitted as surplus. The word “binding” is substituted for “final and conclusive” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “and employees” are added for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.
In subsection (f), before clause (1), the words “in any way” are substituted for “complete, administer, remodel and convert, dispose of, lease and otherwise” to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (1), the words “civil or criminal” are omitted as surplus. In clause (2), the words “political subdivision of a State” are substituted for “local” for consistency.
In subsection (g)(1), before clause (A), the words “facilities and equipment and other”, “(including land)”, and “first” are omitted as surplus.
In subsection (g)(3), the words “and not in lieu of” are omitted as surplus.
Subsection (i) is substituted for section 1(a)(1) (related to authority and functions reserved to Secretary of Housing and Urban Development) of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1968 to eliminate unnecessary words. The reference to 49 App.:1602(c)(1) is translated as a reference to 49 App.:1602(e)(1) because section 2(1) of the Urban Mass Transportation Assistance Act of 1970 (Public Law 91–453, 84 Stat. 962) redesignated subsection (c) as subsection (e). The references to 49 App.:1603(a) (1st sentence), 1604, and 1607c(b) and former 49 App.:1607a are omitted as obsolete because of section 103(a) of the National Mass Transportation Act of 1974 (Public Law 93–503, 88 Stat. 1567) and sections 303(b), 305(a), and 307 of the Federal Public Transportation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95–599, 92 Stat. 2737, 2743, 2747). Reference to 49 App.:1607c(c) is omitted because it was enacted after the Reorganization Plan and was not intended to be within the scope of the Plan.
Subsection (j)(1) is substituted for 49 App.:1608(a) (1st sentence related to 12:1749a(e)) to eliminate unnecessary words.
