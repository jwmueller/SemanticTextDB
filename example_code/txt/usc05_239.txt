“SEC. 2. FINDINGS.“The Congress finds that—“(1) recognition of the services rendered by Federal employees (hereinafter in this Act referred to as ‘national public service’) should be accorded a high and continuing place on the national agenda;

“(2) the National Commission on the Public Service, through its good works, has documented the need for greater advocacy on behalf of those performing national public service;

“(3) although public service is an honorable profession, members of the public do not always perceive it favorably;

“(4) serious obstacles often hinder the Government’s efforts to recruit and retain the best and the brightest for national public service;

“(5) just as the public has a right to expect Federal employees to adhere to the highest standards of excellence and ethicality, so Federal employees have a right to expect an atmosphere of trust and respect, and a sense of accomplishment from their work; and

“(6) an advisory council is needed to provide the President and the Congress with bipartisan, objective assessments of, and recommendations concerning, the Federal workforce.
