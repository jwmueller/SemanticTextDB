“SEC. 1407. CRUISE VESSEL EFFLUENT STANDARDS.“Pursuant to this title and the authority of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act [33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.], as amended, the Administrator may promulgate effluent standards for treated sewage and graywater from cruise vessels operating in the waters of the Alexander Archipelago or the navigable waters of the United States within the State of Alaska or within the Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve. Regulations implementing such standards shall take into account the best available scientific information on the environmental effects of the regulated discharges and the availability of new technologies for wastewater treatment. Until such time as the Administrator promulgates such effluent standards, treated sewage effluent discharges shall not have a fecal coliform bacterial count of greater than 200 per 100 milliliters nor suspended solids greater than 150 milligrams per liter.
