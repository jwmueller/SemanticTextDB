(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the years of service of a member as an air weapons controller shall be computed, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, from the date the member begins training leading to a designation as an air weapons controller, but there shall be excluded from such computation any period of more than 90 days during which the member performs primary duties other than as an air weapons controller.



(d)(1) In time of war, the President may suspend the payment of incentive pay for any hazardous duty described in subsection (a).

(2) A member is entitled to not more than two payments of incentive pay, authorized by this section, for a period of time during which he qualifies for more than one payment of that pay.

He is entitled to the increase for as long as he is qualified for it, for each regular period of instruction, or period of appropriate duty, at which he is engaged for at least two hours, including that performed on a Sunday or holiday, or for the performance of such other equivalent training, instruction, duty, or appropriate duties, as the Secretary may prescribe under section 206(a) of this title.

If the sum of units determined under the preceding sentence equals or exceeds the minimum standard prescribed by the President for entitlement to pay specified under subsections (b) and (c) for a member of corresponding grade who is entitled to basic pay for the entire relevant month, the member shall be entitled to an increase in compensation equal to 1/30 of the monthly incentive pay authorized by subsection (b) or (c) for the performance of that hazardous duty by a member of corresponding grade who is entitled to basic pay for the entire month.

(B) A member who qualifies for entitlement under this paragraph is entitled to the increase for each day in the relevant month in which he is entitled to basic pay pursuant to section 204 of this title or to compensation under section 206 of this title.

(C) In this paragraph, the term “units” means the significant increments of performance prescribed as qualifying standards in regulations promulgated by the President pursuant to this section.

In subsection (a), the words “is also entitled” are substituted for the words “shall, in addition thereto, be entitled”. The words “For the purposes of this subsection” are inserted for clarity. The word “competent” is omitted as surplusage.
In subsection (b), the words preceding the tables are substituted for section 235(b) (words preceding tables) of existing title 37. The words “Years of service computed under section 205” are inserted in the tables for clarity.
In subsection (f), the words “a member of a reserve component of a uniformed service, or of the National Guard” are substituted for the enumeration of the organizations concerned in section 301(d) of existing title 37. The words “when . . . performs, under orders, any duty described in subsection (a)(1)–(11) for members entitled to basic pay” are substituted for the words “when required by competent orders to perform any hazardous duty prescribed by or pursuant to section 235 of this title for members of the uniformed services entitled to receive basic pay and when in consequence of such orders they do perform any hazardous duty so prescribed”.

In subsection (g), the words “entitled to incentive pay under section 301(a)(1) of this title” are substituted for the words “flight pay”.

The words “before January 2 of each year” are substituted for the words “On or before January 1, annually”.
