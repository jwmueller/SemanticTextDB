In subsection (b), the provisions of the source statutes which relate to credit for prior service and diminution of pay are executed, or, insofar as to be executed preserved by technical section 8.
In subsection (d), the words “officer or” are omitted as included within “employee”.
Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.


References in TextThe Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, referred to in subsec. (c)(1)(C), is act June 25, 1938, ch. 676, 52 Stat. 1060, as amended, which is classified generally to chapter 8 (§ 201 et seq.) of Title 29, Labor. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see section 201 of Title 29 and Tables.

Amendments2013—Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 113–66 substituted “Navy Ships Stores Program” for “Army and Air Force Motion Picture Service, Navy Ship’s Stores Ashore” in introductory provisions.
2006—Subsec. (e). Pub. L. 109–435 substituted “Postal Regulatory Commission” for “Postal Rate Commission”.
1997—Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 105–85 inserted “(if any)” after “Academy dairy”.
1996—Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 104–201 inserted “who is” after “An individual” and “and whose employment in such a position began before October 1, 1996, and has been uninterrupted in such a position since that date” after “Academy dairy,”.
1994—Subsec. (f). Pub. L. 103–424 added subsec. (f).
1993—Subsec. (c)(1)(E). Pub. L. 103–3 added subpar. (E).
1990—Subsec. (c)(1). Pub. L. 101–508, § 7202(b)(1), amended par. (1) generally. Prior to amendment, par. (1) read as follows: “laws (other than subchapter IV of chapter 53 of this title, subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title to the extent provided in section 8332(b)(16) of this title, and sections 5550 and 7204 of this title) administered by the Office of Personnel Management; or”.
Subsec. (c)(2). Pub. L. 101–508, § 7202(b)(2), inserted “(except to the extent specifically provided therein)” after “chapter 84”.
1986—Subsec. (c)(1). Pub. L. 99–638 inserted “of this title, subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title to the extent provided in section 8332(b)(16) of this title,”.
Subsec. (c)(2). Pub. L. 99–335 substituted “chapter 81, chapter 84,” for “chapter 81”.

Subsec. (c)(1). Pub. L. 96–54, § 2(a)(6), amended subsec. (c)(1) in same manner as amendment by section 703(c)(2) of Pub. L. 95–454. See 1978 Amendment note set out below.
1978—Subsec. (c)(1). Pub. L. 95–454 substituted “7204” for “7154”, and “Office of Personnel Management” for “Civil Service Commission”. Amendments by section 703(c)(1) and (c)(2) of Pub. L. 95–454 appear to have been inadvertently reversed. Subsec. (c)(1) purported to amend subsec. (c)(1) of this section, and subsec. (c)(2) purported to amend section 3302(2) of this title. However, the amendments specified by Pub. L. 95–454, § 703(c)(1) and (2), were impossible to execute literally. Thus, the amendment by Pub. L. 95–454, § 703(c)(2) was executed to this section, and the amendment by section 703(c)(1) was executed to section 3302(2) of this title as the probable intent of Congress.
