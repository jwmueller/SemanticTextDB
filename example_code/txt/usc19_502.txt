(Aug. 5, 1935, ch. 438, title I, § 4, 49 Stat. 519; 1946 Reorg. Plan No. 3, §§ 101–104, eff. July 16, 1946, 11 F.R. 7875, 60 Stat. 1097; Pub. L. 103–182, title VI, § 689(b), Dec. 8, 1993, 107 Stat. 2222.)

Amendments1993—Pub. L. 103–182, § 689(b)(4), substituted “The Secretary of Transportation and all persons” for “Such collector and all persons”.
Pub. L. 103–182, § 689(b)(3), which directed the substitution of “the Secretary of Transportation shall revoke any endorsement on the vessel’s certificate of documentation or number (when the Secretary is the authority issuing the number under chapter 123 of title 46)” for “said collector shall revoke the registry, enrollment, license, or number of such vessel”, was executed by making the substitution in text which read “said vessel” rather than “such vessel”, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
Pub. L. 103–182, § 689(b)(1), (2), substituted “when the Secretary of Transportation” for “whenever the collector of customs of the district in which any vessel is, or is sought to be, registered, enrolled, licensed, or numbered,” and “is apparent to the Secretary of Transportation” for “is apparent to such collector”.
