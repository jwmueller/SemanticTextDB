Historical and Revision Notes
1948 ActBased on section 4 of title 36, Patriotic Societies and Observances (Jan. 5, 1905, ch. 23, § 4, 33 Stat. 600; June 23, 1910, ch. 372, § 1, 36 Stat. 604).
False personation provision in first part of section was omitted here and incorporated in section 917 of this title.
Words of punishment “$250” and “six months” were substituted for “$500” and “one year” respectively as more consonant with penalties provided for similar offenses in this chapter. (See sections 701, 704, 705 of this title.)
Punishment provisions were also changed to omit reference to “misdemeanor” in view of definitive section 1 of this title.
Words “upon conviction thereof” were omitted as surplusage, because punishment can only be imposed after conviction.
Changes were made in phraseology.

1949 ActThis section [section 17] clarifies the wording of section 706 of title 18, U.S.C., to embrace all service sanitary units whether belonging to the Army, Navy, Air Force, or other branches of the Armed services. (See note to sec. 5 [of 1949 Act, set out in Legislative History note under section 244 of title 18]).
