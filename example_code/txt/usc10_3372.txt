“SEC. 1135. DEPLOYMENT PLANNING REFORM.“(a) Requirement for Priority System.—The Secretary of the Army shall develop a system for identifying the priority for mobilization of Army reserve component units. The priority system shall be based on regional contingency planning requirements and doctrine to be integrated into the Army war planning process.

“(b) Unit Deployment Designators.—The system shall include the use of Unit Deployment Designators to specify the post-mobilization training days allocated to a unit before deployment. The Secretary shall specify standard designator categories in order to group units according to the timing of deployment after mobilization.

“(c) Use of Designators.—(1) The Secretary shall establish procedures to link the Unit Deployment Designator system to the process by which resources are provided for National Guard units.

“(2) The Secretary shall develop a plan that allocates greater funding for training, full-time support, equipment, and manpower in excess of 100 percent of authorized strength to units assigned Unit Deployment Designators that allow fewer post-mobilization training days.

“(3) The Secretary shall establish procedures to identify the command level at which combat units would, upon deployment, be integrated with active component forces consistent with the Unit Deployment Designator system.
