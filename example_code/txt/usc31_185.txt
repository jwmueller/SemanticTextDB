In the section, the words “war-savings certificates” are omitted because the authority to issue them was ended by section 2(b)(3) of the Public Debt Act of 1941 (ch. 7, 55 Stat. 7).
In subsection (a), the words “in his discretion” are omitted as surplus. The word “obligation” is substituted for “bonds and certificates of indebtedness, Treasury bills” for consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “and arising from the payment of internal revenue taxes” are omitted as superseded by 26:6302(c). The word “conditions” is substituted for “terms and conditions” because it is inclusive. The words “upon and” are omitted as surplus.
In subsection (b), the words “The Secretary may designate a bank or trust company that is a depositary under subsection (a) of this section” are substituted for “Any incorporated bank or trust company designated as a depositary by the Secretary of the Treasury under the authority conferred by section 771 of this title, which gives security for such deposits as, and to amounts, by him prescribed, may, upon and subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe, act” to eliminate unnecessary words.
