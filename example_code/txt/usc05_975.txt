(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, if an employee or Member dies after having retired under this subchapter and is survived by a widow or widower, the widow or widower is entitled to an annuity equal to 55 percent (or 50 percent if retired before October 11, 1962) of an annuity computed under section 8339(a)–(i), (n), (p), (q), (r), and (s) as may apply with respect to the annuitant, or of such portion thereof as may have been designated for this purpose under section 8339(j)(1) of this title, unless the right to a survivor annuity was waived under such section 8339(j)(1) or, in the case of remarriage, the employee or Member did not file an election under section 8339(j)(5)(C) or section 8339(k)(2) of this title, as the case may be.

(2) If an annuitant—(A) who retired before April 1, 1948; or

(B) who elected a reduced annuity provided in paragraph (2) of section 8339(k) of this title;


dies and is survived by a widow or widower, the widow or widower is entitled to an annuity in an amount which would have been paid had the annuitant been married to the widow or widower at the time of retirement.

This annuity and the right thereto terminate on the last day of the month before the widow or widower—(A) dies; or

(B) except as provided in subsection (k), remarries before becoming 55 years of age.


(4) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, the annuity payable under this subsection to the widow or widower of a retired employee or Member may not exceed the difference between—(A) the amount which would otherwise be payable to such widow or widower under this subsection (determined without regard to any waiver or designation under section 8339(j)(1) of this title or a prior similar provision of law), and

(2) the sum obtained under such section after increasing his service of the type last performed by the period elapsing between the date of death and the date he would have become 60 years of age.


Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the annuity payable under this subsection to the widow or widower of an employee or Member may not exceed the difference between—

(B) $900; or

(C) $2,700 divided by the number of children;


subject to section 8340 of this title. If the employee or Member is not survived by a spouse or a former spouse who is the natural or adoptive parent of a surviving child of the employee or Member, that surviving child is entitled to an annuity equal to the smallest of—
(i) 75 percent of the average pay of the employee or Member divided by the number of children;

(ii) $1,080; or

(iii) $3,240 divided by the number of children;


subject to section 8340 of this title.

(3) The annuity of a child under this subchapter or under the Act of May 29, 1930, as amended from and after February 28, 1948, commences on the day after the employee or Member dies, or commences or resumes on the first day of the month in which the child later becomes or again becomes a student as described by subsection (a)(3) of this section, if any lump sum paid is returned to the Fund. This annuity and the right thereto terminate on the last day of the month before the child—(A) becomes 18 years of age unless he is then a student as described or incapable of self-support;

(4) If the annuity of a child under this subchapter terminates under paragraph (3)(E) because of marriage, then, if such marriage ends, such annuity shall resume on the first day of the month in which it ends, but only if—(A) any lump sum paid is returned to the Fund; and

(B) that individual is not otherwise ineligible for such annuity.



(f) If a Member heretofore or hereafter separated from the service with title to deferred annuity from the Fund hereafter dies before having established a valid claim for annuity and is survived by a spouse to whom married at the date of separation, the surviving spouse—(1) is entitled to an annuity equal to 55 percent of the deferred annuity of the Member commencing on the day after the Member dies and terminating on the last day of the month before the surviving spouse dies or remarries; or

(2) may elect to receive the lump-sum credit instead of annuity if the spouse is the individual who would be entitled to the lump-sum credit and files application therefor with the Office before the award of the annuity.


Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an annuity payable under this subsection to the surviving spouse of a Member may not exceed the difference between—
(A) the annuity which would otherwise be payable to such surviving spouse under this subsection, and

(B) the amount of the survivor annuity payable to any former spouse of such Member under subsection (h) of this section.


(g) In the case of a surviving spouse whose annuity under this section is terminated because of remarriage before becoming 55 years of age, annuity at the same rate shall be restored commencing on the day the remarriage is dissolved by death, annulment, or divorce, if—(1) the surviving spouse elects to receive this annuity instead of a survivor benefit to which he may be entitled, under this subchapter or another retirement system for Government employees, by reason of the remarriage; and

(2) any lump sum paid on termination of the annuity is returned to the Fund.


(h)(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) through (5) of this subsection, a former spouse of a deceased employee, Member, annuitant, or former Member who was separated from the service with title to a deferred annuity under section 8338(b) of this title is entitled to a survivor annuity under this subsection, if and to the extent expressly provided for in an election under section 8339(j)(3) of this title, or in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree.

(B) The applicable amount, for purposes of subparagraph (A)(i) of this paragraph in the case of a former spouse, is the amount which would be applicable—(i) under subsection (b)(4)(A) of this section in the case of a widow or widower, if the deceased was an employee or Member who died after retirement;

(iii) under subparagraph (A) of subsection (f) of this section in the case of a surviving spouse, if the deceased was a Member described in the first sentence of such subsection.



(3) The commencement and termination of an annuity payable under this subsection shall be governed by the terms of the applicable order, decree, agreement, or election, as the case may be, except that any such annuity—(A) shall not commence before—(i) the day after the employee, Member, or annuitant dies, or

(ii) in the case of an annuity computed by reference to clause (iii) of such paragraph, no later than the last day of the month before the former spouse remarries or dies.



(4) For purposes of this subchapter, a modification in a decree, order, agreement, or election referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be effective—(A) if such modification is made after the retirement or death of the employee or Member concerned, and

(B) to the extent that such modification involves an annuity under this subsection.


(5) For purposes of this subchapter, a decree, order, agreement, or election referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be effective, in the case of a former spouse, to the extent that it is inconsistent with any joint designation or waiver previously executed with respect to such former spouse under section 8339(j)(1) of this title or a similar prior provision of law.

(6) Any payment under this subsection to a person bars recovery by any other person.

(2) the surviving spouse of such individual had been previously married to the individual and subsequently divorced, and the aggregate time married is at least 9 months.


(k)(1) 11 So in original. No subsec. (j) has been enacted.

(2) A remarriage described in paragraph (1) shall not be taken into account for purposes of section 8339(j)(5)(B) or (C) or any other provision of this chapter which the Office may by regulation identify in order to carry out the purposes of this subsection.

“(b)(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1) of this section, a former spouse of an employee or Member who retired before May 7, 1985, or who died after becoming eligible to retire and before such date, is entitled to a survivor annuity under section 8341(b) of title 5, United States Code, as amended by this Act, if—“(A) the retired employee or Member elects, in writing, within eighteen months after the date of enactment of this Act, according to procedures prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, to have the annuity of such employee or Member reduced under section 8339(j) of title 5, United States Code, as amended by this Act, and, except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, to deposit in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund an amount determined by the Office, as nearly as may be administratively feasible, to reflect the amount by which such employee or Member’s annuity would have been reduced had the reduction been in effect since such employee or Member’s annuity commenced, plus interest computed at the annual rate of six percent for each year during which the annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect on and after the date the annuity commenced; or

“(B) where the employee or Member dies or died on or before the one hundred and eightieth day after the date of enactment of this Act or does not make the election described in subparagraph (A)—“(i) the former spouse’s marriage to the employee or Member was dissolved after September 14, 1978, and before May 8, 1987;

“(ii) the former spouse was married to the employee or Member for at least ten years during periods of creditable service under section 8332 of title 5, United States Code;

“(iv) the former spouse files an application for the survivor annuity with the Office on or before May 7, 1989; and

A survivor annuity under subparagraph (B) shall commence on the day after the employee or Member dies or the first day of the second month after the former spouse’s application is received by the Office, whichever occurs later.

“(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), if a retired employee or Member who makes an election under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) does not make the deposit required by such subparagraph, the Office shall collect the amount of the deposit by offset against the employee or Member’s annuity, up to a maximum of 25 per centum of the net annuity otherwise payable to the employee or Member, and the employee or Member is deemed to consent to such offset.

“(3) An election made by an individual under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of this subsection to provide a survivor annuity for any person prospectively voids any election previously made by such individual with respect to such person under section 8339(k)(1) of title 5, United States Code, as amended by this Act, or any similar prior provision of law. Notwithstanding the provisions of such subparagraph (A), an individual who made such an election under such section 8339(k)(1) (or prior provision) shall not be required to make the deposit described in such subparagraph.

“(4)(A) A former spouse of an employee or Member referred to in the matter before subparagraph (A) in paragraph (1) of this section shall be entitled to a survivor annuity under subparagraph (B) of such paragraph if—“(i) the former spouse satisfies the requirements of clauses (ii) through (v) of such subparagraph (B); and

“(ii) there is no surviving spouse of the employee or Member and no other former spouse of such employee or Member who is entitled to receive a survivor annuity under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, based on the service of such employee or Member which is creditable under such subchapter and there is no other person who has been designated to receive a survivor annuity under such subchapter by reason of an insurable interest in such employee or Member.


“(B) For the purposes of this paragraph, the term ‘surviving spouse’ means a widow or a widower as defined in paragraphs (1) and (2), respectively, of section 8341(a) of title 5, United States Code.


“(5) A survivor annuity provided under this subsection shall be 55 per centum of the annuity of the retired employee or Member (or of that portion of the annuity which such employee or Member may have designated for this purpose under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection), as determined under section 8339(a)–(i) and (n) of title 5, United States Code, increased by—“(A) the total percent increase the retired employee or Member was receiving under section 8340 of such title at death, or

“(B) in the case of a retired employee or Member whose date of death precedes the one hundred and eightieth day after the date of enactment of this Act [Nov. 8, 1984], the total percent increase the retired employee or Member would have received under such section 8340 had such individual died on the one hundred and eightieth day after such date of enactment,


and shall not be subject to reduction under section 8341(h)(2) of such title, as amended by this Act.


“(c) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1) of this section, an employee or Member who retired before the one hundred and eightieth day after the date of enactment of this Act [Nov. 8, 1984] and who is married to a spouse acquired after retirement for whom such employee or Member was unable to provide a survivor annuity because—“(1) the employee or Member was married at the time of retirement and elected not to provide a survivor annuity for the employee or Member’s spouse at the time of retirement, or

“(2) the employee or Member failed to notify the Office of the employee or Member’s post-retirement marriage within one year after the marriage,


may elect in writing, within one year after the date of enactment of this Act, in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Office, to provide for a survivor annuity for such spouse under section 8341(b) of title 5, United States Code, as amended by this Act, to have the retired employee or Member’s annuity reduced under section 8339(j) of such title, as so amended, and to deposit in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund an amount determined by the Office, as nearly as may be administratively feasible, to reflect the amount by which such employee or Member’s annuity would have been reduced had the election been continuously in effect since the annuity commenced, plus interest. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the annual rate of interest for each year during which the annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect on and after the date the annuity commenced shall be 6 percent. If the retired employee or Member does not make such deposit, the Office shall collect such amount by offset against such employee or Member’s annuity, up to a maximum of 25 percent of the net annuity otherwise payable to such employee or Member, and such employee or Member is deemed to consent to such offset. The Office shall provide for general public notice of the right to make an election under this subsection. In cases to which paragraph (2) of this subsection applies, the retired employee or Member shall provide the Office with such documentation as the Office shall decide is appropriate, that such employee or Member attempted to elect a reduced annuity with survivor benefit for such employee or Member’s current spouse and that such employee or Member’s election was rejected by the Office because it was untimely filed.

“(d) A deposit required by subsection (b)(1)(A) or (c) of this section may be made by the surviving former spouse or spouse, as applicable, of the retired employee or Member.

“(e) The Office shall determine at the end of each fiscal year—“(1) the cost of survivor annuities provided under subsections (b) and (c) of this section, less an amount determined appropriate by the Office to reflect the value of any deposits made under subsection (b)(1)(A), (c), or (d), and

“(2) the cost of administering subsections (b) and (c).


The Office shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury of the amounts so determined. The Secretary of the Treasury, before closing the account for the fiscal year in question, shall credit to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, such amounts, which shall be available in the same manner as provided under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 8348(a)(1) of title 5, United States Code, as amended by this Act.

“(f) Any individual—“(1) who is entitled to a survivor annuity under subsection (b) of this section or pursuant to an election authorized by reason of the application of subsection (a)(5) of this section,

“(2) as to whom a court order or decree referred to in section 8345(j) of title 5, United States Code (or similar provision of law under a retirement system for Government employees other than the Civil Service Retirement System) has been issued before May 7, 1985, or

“(3) who is entitled (other than as described in paragraph (2)) to an annuity or any portion of an annuity as a former spouse under a retirement system for Government employees as of May 7, 1985,


shall be considered to have satisfied section 8901(10)(C) of title 5, United States Code, as amended by this Act. Notwithstanding subsection (a)(2) of this section, any such individual who otherwise meets the definition of a former spouse under section 8901 of title 5, United States Code, as so amended, may, within 12 months after the date of the enactment of the Federal Employees Benefits Improvement Act of 1986 [Feb. 27, 1986], enroll in an approved health benefits plan described by section 8903 of such title, under the conditions set forth in section 8905(c) of such title, as so amended (other than the conditions prescribed in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) of such section 8905(c)).

“(g)(1) For purposes of subsections (a)(1), (b), (c), (d), and (e), ‘employee’, ‘Member’, and ‘former spouse’ each has the meaning given that term under section 8331 of title 5, United States Code, as amended by this Act.

“(2) For purposes of subsection (a)(2), ‘employee’ and ‘annuitant’ each has the meaning given that term under section 8901 of title 5, United States Code.
