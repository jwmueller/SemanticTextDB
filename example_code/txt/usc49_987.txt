(2) an analysis of the application of the criteria in subsection (c) to that community or consortium.


(c) Criteria for Participation.—In selecting communities, or consortia of communities, for participation in the program established under subsection (a), the Secretary shall apply the following criteria:(1) Size.—For calendar year 1997, the airport serving the community or consortium was not larger than a small hub airport, and—(A) had insufficient air carrier service; or

(4) Overall limit.—No more than 40 communities or consortia of communities, or a combination thereof, may be selected to participate in the program in each year for which funds are appropriated for the program. No community, consortia of communities, nor combination thereof may participate in the program in support of the same project more than once, but any community, consortia of communities, or combination thereof may apply, subsequent to such participation, to participate in the program in support of a different project.

(5) Priorities.—The Secretary shall give priority to communities or consortia of communities where—(A) air fares are higher than the average air fares for all communities;

(B) the community or consortium will provide a portion of the cost of the activity to be assisted under the program from local sources other than airport revenues;

(2) to provide assistance to an underserved airport to obtain service to and from the underserved airport; and

(3) to provide assistance to an underserved airport to implement such other measures as the Secretary, in consultation with such airport, considers appropriate to improve air service both in terms of the cost of such service to consumers and the availability of such service, including improving air service through marketing and promotion of air service and enhanced utilization of airport facilities.


(e) Authority To Make Agreements.—(1) In general.—The Secretary may make agreements to provide assistance under this section.

(2) Authorization of appropriations.—There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary $6,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2012 through 2015 to carry out this section. Such sums shall remain available until expended.
