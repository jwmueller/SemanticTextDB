Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 1, 2 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §§ 1, 2, 35 Stat. 1088).
Section consolidates sections 1 and 2 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
The language referring to collection of the fine was omitted as obsolete and repugnant to the more humane policy of modern law which does not impose criminal consequences on the innocent.
The words “every person so convicted of treason” were omitted as redundant.
Minor change was made in phraseology.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 inserted “under this title but” before “not less than $10,000”.
