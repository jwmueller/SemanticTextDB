Class A stock shall be entitled to a return, payable from income, at the rate of 2 per centum per annum on the amounts of said class A stock actually paid into the telephone bank. Such return shall be cumulative and shall be payable annually into miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury.

(f) Special fund equivalentsIf a firm, association, corporation, or public body is not authorized under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized to acquire stock of the telephone bank, the telephone bank shall, in lieu thereof, permit such organization to pay into a special fund of the telephone bank a sum equivalent to the amount of stock to be purchased. Each reference in this subchapter to capital stock, or to class B, or class C stock, shall include also the special fund equivalents of such stock, and to the extent permitted under the laws of the jurisdiction in which such organization is organized, a holder of special fund equivalents of class B, or class C stock, shall have the same rights and status as a holder of class B or class C stock, respectively. The rights and obligations of the telephone bank in respect of such special fund equivalent shall be identical to its rights and obligations in respect of class B or class C stock, respectively.


(g) Patronage refunds from remaining earnings after provision for operating expenses, reserves for losses, payments in lieu of taxes, and returns on class A and C stockAfter payment of all operating expenses of the telephone bank, including interest on its telephone debentures, setting aside appropriate funds for the reserve for loan losses, and making payments in lieu of taxes, and returns on class A stock as provided in subsection (c), and on class C stock, the Telephone Bank Board shall annually set aside the remaining earnings of the telephone bank for patronage refunds in accordance with the bylaws of the telephone bank. The telephone bank may not establish any reserve other than the reserves referred to in this subsection and in subsection (h).


(h) Reserve for losses due to interest rate fluctuationsThere is hereby established in the telephone bank a reserve for losses due to interest rate fluctuations. Within 30 days after December 22, 1987, the Governor of the telephone bank shall transfer to the reserve for losses due to interest rate fluctuations all amounts in the reserve for contingencies as of December 22, 1987. All amounts so transferred shall not be transferred, directly or indirectly, to the reserve for contingencies. Amounts in the reserve for interest rate fluctuations may be expended only to cover operating losses of the telephone bank (other than losses attributable to loan defaults) and only after taking into consideration any recommendations made by the General Accounting Office under section 1413(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987.
