“SEC. 4002. FINDINGS.“The Congress finds that—“(1) the use of long plastic driftnets is a fishing technique that may result in the entanglement and death of enormous numbers of target and nontarget marine resources in the waters of the North Pacific Ocean, including the Bering Sea;

“(2) there is a pressing need for detailed and reliable information on the number of marine resources that become entangled and die in actively fished driftnets and in driftnets that are lost, abandoned, or discarded; and

“(3) increased efforts are necessary to monitor, assess, and reduce the adverse impacts of driftnets.
