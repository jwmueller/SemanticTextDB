L. 99–335] or the Federal Employees’ Retirement System Open Enrollment Act of 1997 (Public Law 105–61; 111 Stat. 1318 et seq.) [5 U.S.C. 8331 notes], the individual—“(A) is deemed to have elected FERS coverage; and

“(B) shall remain covered by FERS, unless the individual declines, under regulations prescribed by the Office, to be FERS covered.


“(2) Declining fers coverage.—If an individual described under paragraph (1)(B) declines to be FERS covered, such individual shall be CSRS covered, CSRS-Offset covered, or Social Security-Only covered, as would apply in the absence of a FERS election, effective as of the date of the erroneous retirement coverage determination.


“(b) Employee Contributions in Thrift Savings Fund.—If under this section, an individual declines to be FERS covered and instead is Social Security-Only covered, CSRS covered, or CSRS-Offset covered, as would apply in the absence of a FERS election, all employee contributions to the Thrift Savings Fund made during the period of erroneous FERS coverage (and all earnings on such contributions) may remain in the Thrift Savings Fund in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Executive Director, notwithstanding any limit under title 5, United States Code, that would otherwise be applicable.

“(c) Inapplicability of Duration of Erroneous Coverage.—This section shall apply regardless of the length of time the erroneous coverage determination remained in effect.
