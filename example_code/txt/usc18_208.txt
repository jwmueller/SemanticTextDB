Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 1591 of title 19, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Customs Duties (June 17, 1930, ch. 497, title IV, § 591, 46 Stat. 750; Aug. 5, 1935, ch. 438, title III, § 304(a), 49 Stat. 527).
The reference in the first paragraph to persons aiding, contained in the phrase “or aids,” was omitted as unnecessary as such persons are made principals by section 2 of this title.
Words “upon conviction” before “be fined” were omitted as surplusage since punishment cannot be imposed until conviction is secured.
Enumeration of persons at beginning of section and provision preserving forfeitures where authorized by law were omitted as surplusage.
The fourth paragraph was added to the revised section to make clear the intent of Congress that forfeiture is an additional consequence independent of the criminal punishment.
The final paragraph was added to conform with section 1709 of title 19, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
Changes in phraseology were also made.
