Amendments1990—Subsec. (b)(1). Pub. L. 101–627 substituted “any waters of a foreign nation” for “any foreign nation’s territorial sea or exclusive economic zone (or the equivalent), to the extent that that sea or zone is recognized by the United States”.
1986—Pub. L. 99–659 amended section generally. Prior to amendment, section read as follows: “There is established a zone contiguous to the territorial sea of the United States to be known as the fishery conservation zone. The inner boundary of the fishery conservation zone is a line coterminous with the seaward boundary of each of the coastal States, and the outer boundary of such zone is a line drawn in such a manner that each point on it is 200 nautical miles from the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured.”
