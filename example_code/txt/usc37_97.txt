“(1) his spouse;
“(2) his unmarried child (including any of the following categories of children if such child is in fact dependent on the member: a stepchild; an adopted child; or an illegitimate child whose alleged member-father has been judicially decreed to be the father of the child or judicially ordered to contribute to the child’s support, or whose parentage has been admitted in writing by the member) who either—
