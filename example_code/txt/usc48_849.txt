Failure to comply with such requirements shall subject such citizen or national to the same penalties and provisions of law as apply in the case of the failure of such an agent of a foreign principal to comply with such requirements. For purposes of the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, the Federated States of Micronesia shall be considered to be a foreign country.

“(b) Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to a citizen or national of the United States employed by the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia with respect to whom the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia from time to time certifies to the Government of the United States that such citizen or national is an employee of the Federated States of Micronesia whose principal duties are other than those matters specified in the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, as amended, that apply with respect to an agent of a foreign principal. The agency or officer of the United States receiving such certifications shall cause them to be filed with the Attorney General, who shall maintain a publicly available list of the persons so certified.
