Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 1593 of title 19, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Customs Duties (June 17, 1930, ch. 497, title IV, § 593, 46 Stat. 751).
Reference in first paragraph to aiders, contained in words “his, her, or their aiders and abettors” was omitted as unnecessary since such persons are made principals by section 2 of this title. For the same reason words “or assists in so doing” in second paragraph were deleted.
Words “shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor,” in first paragraph were omitted in view of definition of misdemeanor in section 1 of this title.
Conviction provision in first paragraph reading “and on conviction thereof” was deleted as surplusage since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.
Minimum punishment provision “nor less than $50” in second paragraph was deleted.
Forfeiture provision was rephrased to make it clear that forfeiture was not dependent upon conviction.
The final paragraph was added to conform with section 1709 of title 19, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
Changes were made in phraseology.
