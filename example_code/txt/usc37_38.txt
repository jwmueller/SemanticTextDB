In subsection (a), the words “Except as provided by subsection (b) of this section” are inserted for clarity. The words “is also . . . entitled” are substituted for the words “shall, in addition thereto . . . be entitled”. The words “any place outside the United States, or in Alaska or Hawaii” are substituted for the words “beyond the continental limits of the United States or in Alaska”, since, under the source statute, Hawaii was beyond the continental limits of the United States, and the United States, as defined in section 101(1) of this revised title, would otherwise include Alaska and Hawaii. This interpretation conforms to the opinion of the Comptroller General, B–138956, April 20, 1959 (38 Comp. Gen. 710).
In subsection (b), the words “Appropriation of” are substituted for the words “of the funds appropriated to” The words “may not be paid” are substituted for the words “no part . . . shall be available for the payment” The words “member of a uniformed service” are substituted for the words “person in the military service” to conform to subsection (a). The words “Puerto Rico” are inserted for clarity, since the source statute was applicable to that place. The words “Virgin Islands” are inserted, since that unincorporated territory is not covered by the word “possession”. The word “Territory” is omitted as obsolete.
