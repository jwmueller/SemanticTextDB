Historical and Revision Notes
1948 ActBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 317, 321 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §§ 194, 198, 35 Stat. 1125, 1126; May 18, 1916, ch. 126, § 10, 39 Stat. 162; July 28, 1916, ch. 261, § 1, 39 Stat. 418; Feb. 25, 1925, ch. 318, 43 Stat. 977; May 7, 1934, ch. 220, § 1, 48 Stat. 667; Aug. 26, 1935, ch. 693, 49 Stat. 867; Aug. 7, 1939, ch. 557, 53 Stat. 1256).
Each of these two sections has been divided. Provisions relating to theft or larceny of mail were placed in this section.
Words “letter box, mail receptacle, or any mail route” are from section 321 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Such receptacles are authorized depositaries. (See Rosen v. United States, N.Y. 1917, 38 S.Ct. 148, 245 U.S. 467, 62 L.Ed. 406, and Foster v. Biddle, C.C.A. Kan. 1926, 14 F.2d 280, involving indictment under section 317 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed.) No cases are reported of prosecutions for mail theft under section 321 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which relates primarily to malicious mischief respecting letter boxes.
Language omitted from section 317 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and all of section 321 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., except that above quoted, was incorporated in sections 1702 and 1705 of this title.
Words “or aids in buying, receiving, or concealing” were omitted as unnecessary in view of the definition of principal in section 2 of this title.
The smaller penalty for an offense involving $100 or less was added. (See sections 641 and 645 of this title.)
Minor changes were made in phraseology.
