(3) The Secretary may, beginning on October 1, 1990, sell any note evidencing a loan referred to in paragraph (1)—(A) with recourse; or

Such amount may not exceed the amount necessary to rehabilitate the property to a habitable state, and payments shall be made available periodically as such rehabilitation is completed.

(6) The Secretary shall make a loan to finance the sale of real property described in paragraph (1) at an interest rate that is lower than the prevailing mortgage market interest rate in areas where, and to the extent, the Secretary determines, in light of prevailing conditions in the real estate market involved, that such lower interest rate is necessary in order to market the property competitively and is in the interest of the long-term stability and solvency of the Veterans Housing Benefit Program Fund established by section 3722(a) of this title.

(7) During the period that begins on December 16, 2003, and ends on September 30, 2014, the Secretary shall carry out the provisions of this subsection as if—(A) the references in the first sentence of paragraph (1) to “65 percent” and “may be financed” were references to “85 percent” and “shall be financed”, respectively;

(c)(1) The Secretary shall identify and compile information on common factors which the Secretary finds contribute to foreclosures on loans guaranteed under this chapter.

(2) The Secretary shall include a summary of the information compiled, and the Secretary’s findings, under paragraph (1) in the annual report submitted to the Congress under section 529 of this title. As part of such summary and findings, the Secretary shall provide a separate analysis of the factors which contribute to foreclosures of loans which have been assumed.


(d)(1) The Secretary shall furnish to real estate brokers and other real estate sales professionals information on the availability of real property for disposition under this chapter and the procedures used by the Department of Veterans Affairs to dispose of such property.

(2) For the purpose of facilitating the most expeditious sale, at the highest possible price, of real property acquired by the Secretary as the result of a default on a loan guaranteed, insured, or made under this chapter, the Secretary shall list all such property with real estate brokers under such arrangements as the Secretary determines to be most appropriate and cost effective.
