“(2) the hospital (A) meets the requirements of paragraphs (5) and (7) of section 1861(e) of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1395x(e)(5), (7)], (B) is not primarily engaged in providing the services described in section 1961(j)(1)(A) of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1395x(j)(1)(A)], and (C) is primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervision of individuals referred to in paragraph (1) of section 1861(r) of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1395x(r)(1)], to inpatients (i) diagnostic services and therapeutic services for medical diagnosis, treatment, and care of injured, disabled, or sick persons, or (ii) rehabilitation services for the rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons;

“(3) the term ‘spell of illness’ shall have the meaning assigned to it by subsection (a) of section 1861 of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1395x(a)] except that the term ‘inpatient hospital services’ as it appears in such subsection shall have the meaning assigned to it by subsection (a) of this section.”
