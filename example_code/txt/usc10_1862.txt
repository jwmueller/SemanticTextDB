Revised sectionSource (U.S. Code)Source (Statutes at Large)


2665(a)50:172 (last par., less 36th through 64th, and 73d through 109th, words).July 9, 1918, ch. 143, subch. XV, § 8 (last par.), 40 Stat. 888.
2665(b)50:172 (36th through 64th words of last par.).
2665(c)50:172 (73d through 90th words of last par.).
2665(d)50:172 (91st through 109th words of last par.).


In subsection (a), the words “an executive department or the Federal Maritime Board” are substituted for the words “any department or the United States Maritime Commission” to reflect an opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1954/1723) and to name the successor of the United States Maritime Commission. The last 18 words are inserted to reflect that opinion (see the Act of February 20, 1931 (10 U.S.C. 1354)). The words “and dispose of” are omitted as surplusage.
In subsection (b), the words “an executive department or the Federal Maritime Board” are inserted for clarity and to name the successor of the United States Maritime Commission.
In subsections (a) and (b), the word “person” is substituted for the words “individuals, corporations,” since section 1 of title 1 defines the word “person” to cover both individuals and corporations. The words “States or” are omitted as surplusage.
In subsection (c), the words “the selling agency” are substituted for the words “his above representatives selling or disposing of the same”.

1982 ActThis corrects an error in an amendment to 10:2665 made by section 12(3)(B) of the Maritime Act of 1981 (Pub. L. 97–31, Aug. 6, 1981, 95 Stat. 153).

2002—Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 107–296 substituted “Department in which the Coast Guard is operating” for “Department of Transportation”.
1986—Subsec. (d). Pub. L. 99–561, § 4(1), struck out “available for operation and maintenance during a fiscal year” after “Defense”, substituted “costs” for “expenses”, and struck out “during such fiscal year” after “such property”.

Subsec. (f)(1). Pub. L. 99–561, § 4(3)(A), (B), substituted “costs” for “expenses” in provisions preceding subpar. (A) and amended subpar. (C) generally. Prior to amendment, subpar. (C) read as follows: “for expenses to enable operations of forest lands and the production of forest products to continue from the end of one fiscal year through the beginning of the next fiscal year without disruption.”
Subsec. (f)(2), (3). Pub. L. 99–561, § 4(3)(C), amended pars. (2) and (3) generally. Prior to amendment, pars. (2) and (3) read as follows:

“(3) The balance in the reserve account may not exceed $4,000,000. If a deposit under paragraph (2) would cause the balance in the account to exceed that amount, the deposit shall be made only to the extent the amount of the deposit would not cause the balance in the account to exceed $4,000,000.”
1984—Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 98–407, § 809(a)(1), substituted “forest products produced on land owned or leased by a military department or the” for “logs wholly or partly manufactured by, or otherwise procured for, the Army, Navy, or Air Force, or”.
