1303(d)41:421(f).


In subsection (a)(6), the text of 41:421(c)(6) (last sentence) is omitted because 41:407 was repealed by section 4305(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 1996 (Public Law 104–106, 110 Stat. 665).
In subsection (b)(1)(A), the words “after 60 days after November 17, 1988” are omitted as obsolete.
In subsection (b)(1)(B), the words “(as that term is defined in section 3502(11) of title 44)” are omitted because chapter 35 of title 44 was amended generally by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (Public Law 104–13, 109 Stat. 163) and 44:3502 no longer defines “information collection request”. The term “information collection request” is retained in this section of the revised title, however, because 44:ch. 35 still contains provisions about requests for collection of information.
