The Legislature of Guam may by law authorize such authority, any provision of the Organic Act of Guam [48 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.], or any other Act of Congress to the contrary notwithstanding, to borrow money and to issue notes, bonds, and other obligations of such character and maturity, with such security, and in such manner as the legislature may provide. Such notes, bonds, and other obligations shall not be a debt of the United States, or of Guam other than such authority, nor constitute a debt, indebtedness, or the borrowing of money within the meaning of any limitation or restriction on the issuance of notes, bonds, or other obligations contained in any laws of the United States applicable to Guam or to any agency thereof.
