References in TextSection 9567b(c) of this title, referred to in subsec. (a)(1), was in the original “section 178(c) of the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002”, meaning section 178(c) of Pub. L. 107–279, which was translated as reading section 177(c) of Pub. L. 107–279, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because Pub. L. 107–279 does not contain a section 178 and section 177(c) of that Act requires development of a plan.
