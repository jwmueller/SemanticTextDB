Section 13(h) was repealed by section 2 of the Act of August 4, 1972 (Public Law 92–362, 86 Stat. 504). Section 28 was repealed by section 21 of the Act of June 25, 1948 (ch. 645, 62 Stat. 868). Section 32(b)(2) was repealed by section 111(a)(1) of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 (Public Law 87–256, 75 Stat. 538).
In subsection (c), the words “in its discretion”, “by contract or otherwise”, and “firms of architects” are omitted as unnecessary.
