Nonapplicability of certain laws(a) Nothing in sections 203, 205, or 207 of title 18 of the United States Code, or in the second sentence of subsection (a) of section 9 of the Act of August 2, 1939 (53 Stat. 1148), entitled “An Act to prevent pernicious political activities”, as amended, shall be deemed to apply to any person because of his appointment under authority of this title [sections 451 to 471a of this Appendix] or the regulations made pursuant thereto as an uncompensated official of the Selective Service System, or as an individual to conduct hearings on appeals of persons claiming exemption from combatant or noncombatant training because of conscientious objections, or as a member of the National Selective Service Appeal Board.

(b) All functions performed under this title [sections 451 to 471a of this Appendix] shall be excluded from the operation of the Administrative Procedure Act (60 Stat. 237) [5 U.S.C. 551 et seq. and 701 et seq.] except as to the requirements of section 3 of such Act [5 U.S.C. 552]. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, no regulation issued under this Act shall become effective until the expiration of thirty days following the date on which such regulation has been published in the Federal Register. After the publication of any regulation and prior to the date on which such regulation becomes effective, any person shall be given an opportunity to submit his views to the Director on such regulation, but no formal hearing shall be required on any such regulation. The requirements of this subsection may be waived by the President in the case of any regulation if he (1) determines that compliance with such requirements would materially impair the national defense, and (2) gives public notice to that effect at the time such regulation is issued.
