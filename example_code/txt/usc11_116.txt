(Pub. L. 95–598, Nov. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 2614.)

Historical and Revision Notes
senate report no. 95–989Section 750 forbids the trustee from distributing a security other than a customer name security. The term “distribution” refers to a distribution to customers in satisfaction of net equity claims and is not intended to preclude the trustee from liquidating securities under proposed 11 U.S.C. 748.
