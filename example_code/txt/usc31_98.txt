 31:18a.Sept. 12, 1950, ch. 946, § 104, 64 Stat. 834; Reorg. Plan No. 2 of 1970, eff. July 1, 1970, § 102(a), 84 Stat. 2085.


In the section, before clause (1), the words “To improve economy and efficiency in the United States Government” are substituted for “(with a view of securing greater economy and efficiency in the conduct of the public service)” in 31:18 and “with a view to efficient and economical service” in 31:18a to eliminate unnecessary words. The word “President” is substituted for “Office of Management and Budget, when directed by the President” in 31:18 and “President, through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget” in 31:18a because sections 101 and 102(a) of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (eff. July 1, 1970, 84 Stat. 2085) designated the Bureau of the Budget as the Office of Management and Budget and transferred all functions of the Bureau to the President. In clause (1), the words “existing” and “detailed” are omitted as surplus.
