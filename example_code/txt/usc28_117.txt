Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 17, 22 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§ 13, 18, 36 Stat. 1089; Oct. 3, 1913, ch. 18, 38 Stat. 203; Sept. 14, 1922, ch. 306, §§ 3, 5, 42 Stat. 839; Mar. 2, 1929, ch. 488, § 1, 45 Stat. 1475; June 7, 1934, ch. 426, 48 Stat. 926; June 25, 1936, ch. 804, 49 Stat. 1921; Aug. 24, 1937, ch. 754, § 4, 50 Stat. 753; Dec. 29, 1942, ch. 835, § 1, 56 Stat. 1094).
Section consolidates all provisions of sections 17 and 22 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to designation and assignment of circuit judges.
The revised section omits a reference to the Chief Justice contained in said section 22, since in exercising the powers under subsection (b), he acts as a circuit justice.
Paragraph (d) of said section 17, making the section applicable to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, is omitted since such court is included in this revision because the District of Columbia is made a separate circuit. (See section 41 of this title.)
Provisions of said sections 17 and 22 authorizing the senior Associate Justice to act in the absence of the Chief Justice of the United States were omitted as surplusage in view of specific authority to so act in section 3 of this title.
The words in said section 17 “for such time as the business of such district court may require,” were omitted as inconsistent with the language of said section 22 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which employed the words “the public interest requires” and “from time to time and until he shall otherwise direct.” The revised section and sections 294 and 296 of this title make clear the power to make designation and assignment without any limitation of time, to revoke such designation and assignment and to make, from time to time, new designations and assignments.
The term “chief judge” of the circuit was substituted for “senior circuit judge.” (See reviser’s note under section 136 of this title.)
References in said sections 17 and 22 to retired judges were omitted as covered by section 294 of this title.
Other provisions of said section 17 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 292, 295 and 296 of this title.
Other provisions of said section 22 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in section 296 of this title.
Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.
