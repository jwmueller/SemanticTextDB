“(a) Findings.—The Congress finds that—“(1) false, fictitious, and fraudulent claims and statements in Government programs are a serious problem;

“(2) false, fictitious, and fraudulent claims and statements in Government programs result in the loss of millions of dollars annually by allowing persons to receive Federal funds to which they are not entitled;
