(Added Pub. L. 88–130, § 1(10)(C), Sept. 24, 1963, 77 Stat. 185; amended Pub. L. 107–295, title IV, § 416(a)(3), Nov. 25, 2002, 116 Stat. 2121.)

Amendments2002—Pub. L. 107–295 substituted “separation” for “severance” in section catchline, added subsecs. (b) to (d), and struck out former subsec. (b) which read as follows: “Each officer discharged under this section or under section 282, 283, or 284 of this title is entitled to a lump-sum payment computed by multiplying his years of active commissioned service, but not more than twelve, by two months’ basic pay of the grade in which he is serving on the date of his discharge. In determining the total number of years of active service to be used as a multiplier in computing this payment, a part of a year that is six months or more is counted as a whole year and a part of a year that is less than six months is disregarded. The acceptance of a lump-sum payment under this section does not deprive a person of any retirement benefits from the United States. However, there shall be deducted from each of his retirement payments so much thereof as is based on the service for which he has received payment under this section until the total amount deducted equals the amount of the lump-sum payment.”

L. 107–295, title IV, § 416(c), Nov. 25, 2002, 116 Stat. 2122, provided that: “The amendments made by paragraphs (2), (3), (4), and (5) of subsection (a) [amending this section and sections 283, 286a, and 327 of this title] shall take effect 4 years after the date of enactment of this Act [Nov. 25, 2002], except that subsection (d) of section 286 of title 14, United States Code, as amended by paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of this section, shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act and shall apply with respect to conduct on or after that date. The amendments made to the table of sections of chapter 11 of title 14, United States Code, by paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of subsection (b) [amending the table of sections for this chapter] of this section shall take effect 4 years after the date of enactment of this Act.”
