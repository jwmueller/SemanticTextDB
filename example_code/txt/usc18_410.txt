(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 752; Oct. 31, 1951, ch. 655, § 26, 65 Stat. 720; Pub. L. 90–19, § 24(d), May 25, 1967, 81 Stat. 28; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(H), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on sections 1423–1425 of title 42, U.S.C., 1940 ed., The Public Health and Welfare (Sept. 1, 1937, ch. 896, §§ 23–25, 50 Stat. 899).
Three sections were consolidated with changes of phraseology and arrangement necessary to effect consolidation.
Words “upon conviction thereof”, in each section were omitted as surplusage since punishment cannot be imposed until after conviction.
The provisions of section 1424 of title 42, U.S.C., 1940 ed., The Public Health and Welfare, relating to conspiracy were omitted as inconsistent with the general conspiracy statute, section 371 of this title, both as to punishment and allegation and proof of an overt act. (See reviser’s note under section 493 of this title.)

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $1,000” in last par.
1967—Pub. L. 90–19 substituted “Department of Housing and Urban Development” for “Public Housing Administration” in section catchline and text, and “Department” for “Administration” wherever appearing in text.
1951—Act Oct. 31, 1951, substituted “Public Housing Administration” for “United States Housing Authority” in section catchline and text, and “Administration” for “Authority”, wherever appearing in text.
