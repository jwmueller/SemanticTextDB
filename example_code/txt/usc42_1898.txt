(g) Prohibition of State imposition of premium taxesNo State may impose a premium tax or similar tax with respect to payments to Medicare+Choice organizations under section 1395w–23 of this title or premiums paid to such organizations under this part.


(h) Permitting use of segments of service areasThe Secretary shall permit a Medicare+Choice organization to elect to apply the provisions of this section uniformly to separate segments of a service area (rather than uniformly to an entire service area) as long as such segments are composed of one or more Medicare+Choice payment areas.
