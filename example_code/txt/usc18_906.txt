Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 399 (June 25, 1910, ch. 395, § 3, 36 Stat. 825).
Words “deemed guilty of a felony” were deleted as unnecessary in view of definition of felony in section 1 of this title. (See reviser’s note under section 550 of this title.)
Words “and on conviction thereof shall be” were deleted as surplusage since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.
The references to persons causing, procuring, aiding or assisting were omitted as unnecessary as such persons are made principals by section 2 of this title.
Words “Possession of the United States” were inserted twice. (See reviser’s note under section 2421 of this title.)
Minor changes were made in phraseology.
