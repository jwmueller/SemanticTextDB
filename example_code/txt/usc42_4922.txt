“(a) Findings.—The Congress finds that—“(1) the Nation’s nonrenewable energy resources are being rapidly depleted;

“(2) buildings owned by units of local government and public care institutions are major consumers of energy, and such units and institutions have been especially burdened by rising energy prices and fuel shortages;

“(3) substantial energy conservation can be achieved in buildings owned by units of local government and public care institutions through the implementation of energy conservation maintenance and operating procedures; and

“(4) units of local government and public care institutions in many instances need financial assistance in order to conduct energy audits and to identify energy conservation maintenance and operating procedures and to evaluate the potential benefits of acquiring and installing energy conservation measures.


“(b) Purpose.—It is the purpose of this part [part 2 (§§ 310–312) of title III of Pub. L. 95–619, enacting sections 6371j and 6372 to 6372i of this title] to authorize grants to States and units of local government and public care institutions to assist them in conducting preliminary energy audits and energy audits in identifying and implementing energy conservation maintenance and operating procedures and in evaluating energy conservation measures to reduce the energy use and anticipated energy costs of buildings owned by units of local government and public care institutions.”
