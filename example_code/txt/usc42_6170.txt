§ 10164. Survey
After the MRS Commission submits its report to the Congress under section 10163 of this title, the Secretary may conduct a survey and evaluation of potentially suitable sites for a monitored retrievable storage facility. In conducting such survey and evaluation, the Secretary shall consider the extent to which siting a monitored retrievable storage facility at each site surveyed would—(1) enhance the reliability and flexibility of the system for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste established under this chapter;

(2) minimize the impacts of transportation and handling of such fuel and waste;

(3) provide for public confidence in the ability of such system to safely dispose of the fuel and waste;

(4) impose minimal adverse effects on the local community and the local environment;

(5) provide a high probability that the facility will meet applicable environmental, health, and safety requirements in a timely fashion;

(6) provide such other benefits to the system for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste as the Secretary deems appropriate; and

(7) unduly burden a State in which significant volumes of high-level radioactive waste resulting from atomic energy defense activities are stored.
