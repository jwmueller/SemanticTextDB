“Where—“(1) one or more persons were entitled (without the application of section 202(j)(1) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 402(j)(1)]) to monthly benefits under section 202 or 223 of such Act [42 U.S.C. 402, 423] for January 1968 on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of an individual, and

“(2) one or more persons (not included in paragraph (1)) become entitled to monthly benefits under such section 202 [42 U.S.C. 402] for February 1968 on the basis of such wages and self-employment by reason of the amendments made to such Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] by sections 104 [amending this section and sections 402, 416, 422, and 425 of this title], 112 [amending section 402 of this title], 150 [amending section 416 of this title], 151 [amending section 402 of this title and section 228 of Title 45, Railroads], 156 [amending section 416 of this title], and 157 of this Act [amending section 402 and 402 note of this title], and

“(3) the total of benefits to which all persons are entitled under such section 202 or 223 [42 U.S.C. 402, 423] on the basis of such wages and self-employment for February 1968 are reduced by reason of section 203(a) of such Act, as amended by this Act (or would, but for the penultimate sentence of such section 203(a), be so reduced),


then the amount of the benefit to which each such person referred to in paragraph (1) is entitled for months after January 1968 shall be increased, after the application of such section 203(a) [42 U.S.C. 403(a)], to the amount it would have been if the person or persons referred to in paragraph (2) were not entitled to a benefit referred to in such paragraph.”
