§ 58. Transcripts from records of Louisiana
Any copy of a plat of survey, or transcript from the records of the office of the former surveyor general of Louisiana, duly certified, shall be admitted as evidence in all the courts of the United States and the Territories thereof.
(R.S. § 2225.)

Codification
The word “former” was inserted in text before “surveyor general” because of the discontinuance of the office of surveyor general in Louisiana.
R.S. § 2225 derived from act Mar. 3, 1831, ch. 116, § 5, 4 Stat. 493.
