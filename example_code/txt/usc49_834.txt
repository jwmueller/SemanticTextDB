“(b) Non-OEP Airports.—“(1) Non-OEP airports report.—Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act [Feb. 14, 2012], the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall publish a report, after consultation with representatives of appropriate Administration employee groups, airport operators, air carriers, general aviation representatives, aircraft and avionics manufacturers, and third parties that have received letters of qualification from the Administration to design and validate required navigation performance flight paths for public use (in this section referred to as ‘qualified third parties’) that includes the following:“(A) RNP operations for non-oep airports.—A list of required navigation performance procedures (as defined in FAA order 8260.52(d)) to be developed, certified, and published, and the air traffic control operational changes, to maximize the fuel efficiency and airspace capacity of NextGen commercial operations at 35 non-OEP small, medium, and large hub airports other than those referred to in subsection (a)(1). The Administrator shall choose such non-OEP airports considered appropriate by the Administrator to produce maximum operational benefits, including improved fuel efficiency and emissions reductions that do not have public RNP procedures that produce such benefits on the date of enactment of this Act. The Administrator shall, to the maximum extent practicable, avoid overlays of existing flight procedures, but if unavoidable, the Administrator shall clearly identify each required navigation performance procedure that is an overlay of an existing instrument flight procedure and the reason why such an overlay was used.

“(B) Coordination and implementation activities for non-oep airports.—A description of the activities and operational changes and approvals required to coordinate and to utilize the procedures required by subparagraph (A) at each of the airports described in such subparagraph.

“(C) Implementation plan for non-oep airports.—A plan for implementation of the procedures required by subparagraph (A) that establishes—“(i) clearly defined budget, schedule, project organization, and leadership requirements;

“(ii) specific implementation and transition steps;

“(iii) coordination and communications mechanisms with qualified third parties;

“(iv) plans to address human factors, training, and other issues for air traffic controllers surrounding the adoption of RNP procedures in the en route and terminal environments, including in a mixed operational environment;

“(v) baseline and performance metrics for—     “(I) measuring the Administration’s progress in implementing the plan, including the percentage utilization of required navigation performance in the national airspace system; and
