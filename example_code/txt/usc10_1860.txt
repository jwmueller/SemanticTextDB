(2) Not later than 10 days after the date on which the Secretary of a military department determines to acquire an interest in land under the authority of this subsection, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives written notice containing a description of the property and interest to be acquired and the reasons for the acquisition.

(2) The Secretary concerned may have proceedings brought in the name of the United States to acquire the land after the end of the 21-day period beginning on the date on which the report is received by the committees or, if over sooner, the end of the 14-day period beginning on the date on which a copy of the report is provided in an electronic medium pursuant to section 480 of this title.


(g) Exception to Advance Notice Requirement.—If the Secretary of a military department determines that the use of condemnation, eminent domain, or seizure to acquire an interest in land is required under subsection (a) to satisfy a requirement vital to national security, and that any delay would be detrimental to national security or the protection of health, safety, or the environment, the Secretary may have proceedings brought in the name of the United States to acquire the land in advance of submitting the report required by subsection (f)(1)(B). However, the Secretary shall submit the report not later than seven days after commencement of the legal proceedings with respect to the land.

(h) Land Acquisition Options in Advance of Military Construction Projects.—(1) The Secretary of a military department may acquire an option on a parcel of real property before or after its acquisition is authorized by law, if the Secretary considers it suitable and likely to be needed for a military project of the military department under the jurisdiction of the Secretary.

(2) As consideration for an option acquired under paragraph (1), the Secretary may pay, from funds available to the military department under the jurisdiction of the Secretary for real property activities, an amount that is not more than 12 percent of the appraised fair market value of the property.
