“(a) Findings.—The Congress finds that—“(1) Caribbean and Central American countries historically have had close economic, political, and cultural ties to the United States;

“(2) promoting economic and political stability in the Caribbean and Central America is in the national security interests of the United States;

“(3) the economic and political stability of the nations of the Caribbean and Central America can be strengthened significantly by the attraction of foreign and domestic investment specifically devoted to employment generation; and
