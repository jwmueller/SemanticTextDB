In paragraph (5), the words “ocean freight forwarder” are substituted for “ocean transportation intermediary, as defined by section 1702(17)(A) of this Appendix” because the definition of “ocean transportation intermediary” in section 1702(17)(A) contains a definition of “ocean freight forwarder” which is restated as a separate definition.
