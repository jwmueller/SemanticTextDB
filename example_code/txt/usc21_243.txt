(II) promptly conduct an investigation in coordination with trading partners, as applicable, to determine whether the product is an illegitimate product, which shall include validating any applicable transaction history and transaction information in the possession of the repackager and otherwise investigating to determine whether the product is an illegitimate product, and, beginning 5 years after November 27, 2013 (except as provided pursuant to subsection (a)(5)), verifying the product at the package level, including the standardized numerical identifier.


(ii) Cleared productIf the repackager makes the determination that a suspect product is not an illegitimate product, the repackager shall promptly notify the Secretary, if applicable, of such determination and such product may be further distributed.


(iii) RecordsA repackager shall keep records of the investigation of a suspect product for not less than 6 years after the conclusion of the investigation.



(B) Illegitimate product(i) In generalUpon determining, in coordination with the manufacturer, that a product in the possession or control of a repackager is an illegitimate product, the repackager shall, in a manner that is consistent with the systems and processes of such repackager—(I) quarantine such product within the possession or control of the repackager from product intended for distribution until such product is dispositioned;
