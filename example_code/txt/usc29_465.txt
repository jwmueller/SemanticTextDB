(ii) as the dependent child of the employee.


Such term shall also include a child who is born to or placed for adoption with the covered employee during the period of continuation coverage under this part.

(B) Special rule for terminations and reduced employmentIn the case of a qualifying event described in section 1163(2) of this title, the term “qualified beneficiary” includes the covered employee.


(C) Special rule for retirees and widowsIn the case of a qualifying event described in section 1163(6) of this title, the term “qualified beneficiary” includes a covered employee who had retired on or before the date of substantial elimination of coverage and any other individual who, on the day before such qualifying event, is a beneficiary under the plan—(i) as the spouse of the covered employee,
