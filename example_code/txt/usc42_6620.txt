§ 12401. Finding, purposes, and definitions(a) FindingCongress finds that it is in the national interest to accelerate efforts to develop a domestic capability to economically produce hydrogen in quantities that will make a significant contribution toward reducing the Nation’s dependence on conventional fuels.


(b) PurposesThe purposes of this chapter are—(1) to direct the Secretary of Energy to conduct a research, development, and demonstration program leading to the production, storage, transport, and use of hydrogen for industrial, residential, transportation, and utility applications;

(2) to direct the Secretary to develop a technology assessment and information transfer program among the Federal agencies and aerospace, transportation, energy, and other entities; and

(3) to develop renewable energy resources as a primary source of energy for the production of hydrogen.


(c) DefinitionsAs used in this chapter, the term:(1) “critical technology” (or “critical technical issue”) means a technology (or issue) that, in the opinion of the Secretary, requires understanding and development in order to take the next needed step in the development of hydrogen as an economic fuel or storage medium;
