(Aug. 11, 1888, ch. 860, § 1, 25 Stat. 419; July 26, 1947, ch. 343, title II, § 205(a), 61 Stat. 501.)

Codification
Section is from act Aug. 11, 1888, the River and Harbor Appropriation Act of 1888.
In the original text the words “said reservoirs” appeared instead of “reservoirs at the headwaters of the Mississippi river.” The provision from which this section is derived, however, followed an appropriation “for continuing operations upon the reservoirs at the headwaters of the Mississippi river.”


Change of Name
Department of War designated Department of the Army and title of Secretary of War changed to Secretary of the Army by section 205(a) of act July 26, 1947, ch. 343, title II, 61 Stat. 501. Section 205(a) of act July 26, 1947, was repealed by section 53 of act Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 641. Section 1 of act Aug. 10, 1956, enacted “Title 10, Armed Forces” which in sections 3010 to 3013 continued Department of the Army under administrative supervision of Secretary of the Army.
