Such studies shall take into consideration all relevant factors regarding (1) the conservation and protection of all such whales, (2) the distribution, migration patterns, and population dynamics of these mammals, and (3) the effects on all such whales of habitat destruction, disease, pesticides, and other chemicals, disruption of migration patterns, and food shortages for the purpose of developing adequate and effective measures, including appropriate laws and regulations, to conserve and protect such mammals. The Secretary of Commerce shall report on such studies, together with such recommendations as he deems appropriate, including suggested legislation, to the Congress no later than January 1, 1980.

Study of Eastern Gray Whale PopulationPub. L. 106–562, title IV, § 401, Dec. 23, 2000, 114 Stat. 2807, provided that:
“(a) Study.—Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Dec. 23, 2000] and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of Commerce shall initiate a study of the environmental and biological factors responsible for the significant increase in mortality events of the eastern gray whale population, and the other potential impacts these factors may be having on the eastern gray whale population.

“(b) Consideration of Western Population Information.—The Secretary should ensure that, to the greatest extent practicable, information from current and future studies of the western gray whale population is considered in the study under this section, so as to better understand the dynamics of each population and to test different hypotheses that may lead to an increased understanding of the mechanism driving their respective population dynamics.
