References in TextThe Covenant, referred to in subsecs. (a) and (b), is the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America, which is contained in section 1 of Pub. L. 94–241, set out as a note under section 1801 of this title.
Public Law 94–241, referred to in subsecs. (a) and (b), is Pub. L. 94–241, Mar. 24, 1976, 90 Stat. 263, as amended, which is classified generally to subchapter I (§ 1801 et seq.) of this chapter. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Tables.
Sections 601 and 602 of Public Law 94–241, referred to in subsec. (c), probably mean sections 601 and 602 of the Covenant, because Pub. L. 94–241 does not contain a section 601 or 602.
