In the section, the words “the head of” are added for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.
In subsection (a), the words “of the United States” are omitted as surplus. The word “President” is substituted for “Director of the Office of Management and Budget” because sections 101 and 102(a) of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (eff. July 1, 1970, 84 Stat. 2085) redesignated the Bureau of the Budget as the Office of Management and Budget and transferred all functions of the Bureau to the President.
In subsection (b)(3), the words “as a whole” and “respective” are omitted as surplus.
Subsection (c)(2) is substituted for 31:49 and the words “and, to the extent he deems necessary, the authority vested in him by section 49 of this title” in 31:66(a) for clarity and consistency. H. Rept. 2556, 81st Cong. (1950), states that the Comptroller General will be able to prescribe appropriation and fund accounting systems under 31:49 “in terms of principles, standards and related requirements rather than in terms of detailed forms and procedures”. The reference to the judicial branch covers authority that the Comptroller General was given under 31:49 that applies to departments and establishments except the Supreme Court that was not superseded by the source provisions restated in subsection (a) of this section.

Amendments2002—Subsec. (c)(1). Pub. L. 107–217 substituted “section 121(b) of title 40” for “section 205(b) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 486(b))”.

Adoption of Capital Accounting StandardsPub. L. 101–576, title III, § 307, Nov. 15, 1990, 104 Stat. 2855, provided that: “No capital accounting standard or principle, including any human capital standard or principle, shall be adopted for use in an executive department or agency until such standard has been reported to the Congress and a period of 45 days of continuous session of the Congress has expired.”
