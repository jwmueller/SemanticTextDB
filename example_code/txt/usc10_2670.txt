625134 U.S.C. 364 (less 10th, and last 47 words).Feb. 4, 1919, ch. 14, § 9 (less applicability to regulations), 40 Stat. 1057; renumbered § 11 and amended Aug. 7, 1942, ch. 551, § 1, 56 Stat. 745.


The term “flag officers” is used generically in 34 U.S.C. 364. Officers of the Marine Corps who meet the duty requirements, if in the equivalent grades, are, therefore, within its terms and the authority to make the awards has been delegated to such officers.
