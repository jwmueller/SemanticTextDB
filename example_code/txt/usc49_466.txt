In this section, the words “or incident” and “and incident” are added for consistency in this part.
In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words “locomotive, tender, or locomotive or tender part or appurtenance . . . the locomotive or tender” are substituted for “locomotive boiler or its appurtenances . . . said locomotive” in 45:32 and the text of 45:30 (1st sentence related to 45:32) for clarity and because of the restatement. The word “personal” is substituted for “to one or more persons” to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (1), the word “immediately” is substituted for “forthwith” for consistency in this chapter. In clause (2), the words “operated under its own power” are substituted for “cannot be run by its own steam” for clarity. The words “hindrance or” are omitted as being included in “interfering”. The word “investigation” is substituted for “inspection” for consistency in this section.
In subsection (c), the words “at any time call upon the director of locomotive inspection for a report of any accident embraced in section 32 of this title, and upon the receipt of said report” are omitted as obsolete because of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1965 (eff. July 27, 1965, 79 Stat. 1320) and 49 App.:1655(e)(1)(E)–(G). The text of 45:33 (2d sentence) is omitted as surplus. The words “civil action” are substituted for “suit or action” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words “resulting from” are substituted for “growing out of” for clarity. The words “or investigation” are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement.
