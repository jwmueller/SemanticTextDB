Ex. Ord. No. 12191. Federal Facility Ridesharing Program
Ex. Ord. No. 12191, Feb. 1, 1980, 45 F.R. 7997, provided:
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and statutes of the United States of America, and in order to increase ridesharing as a means to conserve petroleum, reduce congestion, improve air quality, and provide an economical way for Federal employees to commute to work, it is hereby ordered as follows:

1–1. Responsibilities of Executive Agencies1–101. Executive agencies shall promote the use of ridesharing (carpools, vanpools, privately leased buses, public transportation, and other multi-occupancy modes of travel) by personnel working at Federal facilities. Agency actions pursuant to this Order shall be consistent with Circular A–118 issued by the Office of Management and Budget.
1–102. Agencies shall establish an annual ridesharing goal tailored to each facility, and expressed as a percentage of fulltime personnel working at that facility who use ridesharing in the commute between home and work. Agencies that share facilities or that are within easy walking distance of one another should coordinate their efforts to develop and implement ridesharing opportunities.
1–103. Agencies shall designate, in accordance with OMB Circular A–118, an employee transportation coordinator. Agencies that share facilities may designate a single transportation coordinator. The coordinator shall assist employees in forming carpools or vanpools (employee-owned or leased) and facilitate employee participation in ridesharing matching programs. The coordinator shall publicize within the facility the availability of public transportation. The coordinator shall also communicate employee needs for new or improved transportation service to the appropriate local public transit authorities or other organizations furnishing multi-passenger modes of travel.
1–104. Agencies shall report to the Administrator of General Services, hereinafter referred to as the Administrator, the goals established, the means developed to achieve those goals, and the progress achieved. These reports shall be in such form and frequency as the Administrator may require.

1–2. Responsibilities of the Administrator of General Services1–201. The Administrator shall issue such regulations as are necessary to implement this Order.
1–202. The Administrator may exempt small, remotely located Federal facilities from the requirements of Sections 1–102, 1–103, and 1–104 on his own initiative or upon request of the agency. An exemption shall be granted in whole or in part when, in the judgment of the Administrator, the requirements of those Sections would not yield significant ridesharing benefits.
1–203. The Administrator shall, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, periodically provide agencies with guidelines, instructions, and other practical aids for establishing, implementing, and improving their ridesharing programs.
1–204. The Administrator shall assist in coordinating the ridesharing activities of the agencies with the efforts of the Department of Energy, under the Federal Energy Management Program and in the development of an emergency energy conservation plan for the Federal government.
1–205. The Administrator shall take into consideration the advice of the Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air Act, as amended [42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.] in performing his responsibilities under this Order.
1–206. The Administrator shall, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, report annually to the President on the performance of the agencies in implementing the policies and actions contained in this Order. The report shall include (a) an assessment of each agency’s performance, including the reasonableness of its goals and the adequacy of its effort, (b) a comparison of private sector and State and local government ridesharing efforts with those of the Federal government, and (c) recommendations for additional actions necessary to remove barriers or to provide additional incentives to encourage more ridesharing by personnel at Federal facilities.
