Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 27 of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Conservation, and title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 196 (May 7, 1894, ch. 72, § 5, 28 Stat. 74; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§ 115, 291, 36 Stat. 1130, 1167; June 5, 1924, ch. 260, 43 Stat. 388; June 28, 1938, ch. 778, § 1, 52 Stat. 1213).
Section consolidates section 196 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with a portion of section 27 of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with necessary changes in arrangement and phraseology. Reference to parts of Yellowstone National Park in Montana and Idaho is derived from said section 27. Other provisions of said section are incorporated in sections 631 and 632 of this title.

Provisions of section 196 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for appointment of deputies and maintenance of offices by the clerk and marshal were omitted as covered by sections 541 [see 561], 542 [see 561], and 751 of this title.
