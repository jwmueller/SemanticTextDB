§ 17194. Enhanced geothermal systems research and development(a) In generalThe Secretary shall support a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application for enhanced geothermal systems, including the programs described in subsection (b).


(b) Programs(1) Enhanced geothermal systems technologiesThe Secretary shall support a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of the technologies and knowledge necessary for enhanced geothermal systems to advance to a state of commercial readiness, including advances in—(A) reservoir stimulation;

(B) reservoir characterization, monitoring, and modeling;

(C) stress mapping;

(D) tracer development;

(E) three-dimensional tomography; and

(F) understanding seismic effects of reservoir engineering and stimulation.


(2) Enhanced geothermal systems reservoir stimulation(A) ProgramIn collaboration with industry partners, the Secretary shall support a program of research, development, and demonstration of enhanced geothermal systems reservoir stimulation technologies and techniques. A minimum of 4 sites shall be selected in locations that show particular promise for enhanced geothermal systems development. Each site shall—(i) represent a different class of subsurface geologic environments; and

(ii) take advantage of an existing site where subsurface characterization has been conducted or existing drill holes can be utilized, if possible.


(B) Consideration of existing siteThe Desert Peak, Nevada, site, where a Department of Energy and industry cooperative enhanced geothermal systems project is already underway, may be considered for inclusion among the sites selected under subparagraph (A).
