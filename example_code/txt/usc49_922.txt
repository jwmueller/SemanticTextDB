In subsection (a)(1), the text of 49 App.:1371(e)(1) (words before semicolon related to terminal and intermediate points) is omitted as obsolete because of 49 App.:1551(a)(1)(C) and because interstate and overseas air transportation is no longer regulated. The words “type of” are added for clarity. The word “provided” is substituted for “rendered” for consistency in the revised title.
In subsection (a)(2), the words before clause (A) are added for clarity. Clause (A) is substituted for 49 App.:1371(e)(1) (words after semicolon) for clarity and consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words.

The words “terminal and intermediate” are omitted as surplus. The words “between which the air carrier is authorized to provide the transportation” are added for clarity and consistency.
In subsection (a)(3), the words “or routes” are omitted because of 1:1. The words “The Secretary” are added for clarity.
In subsection (a)(4), the words “or areas” are omitted because of 1:1.

In clause (A), the words “provide the carrier an opportunity” are substituted for “set such application” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.
