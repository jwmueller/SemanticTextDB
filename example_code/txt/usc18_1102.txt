(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 828; Pub. L. 95–598, title III, § 314(k), Nov. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 2678.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 52(d) of title 11, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Bankruptcy (May 27, 1926, ch. 406, § 11d, 44 Stat. 665; June 22, 1938, ch. 575, § 1, 52 Stat. 856).
The 3-year-limitation provision was omitted as unnecessary in view of the general statute, section 3282 of this title.
The words “or a discharge denied” and “or denial of discharge” were added on the recommendation of the Department of Justice to supply an omission in existing law.
Other subsections of said section 52 of title 11, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 151–154 and 3057 of this title.
Other minor changes of phraseology were made.
