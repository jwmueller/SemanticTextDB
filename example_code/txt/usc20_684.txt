The Secretary shall obtain the advice of and recommendations from individuals and representatives of the groups involved in student financial assistance programs under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, such as students, legal assistance organizations that represent students, institutions of higher education, State student grant agencies, guaranty agencies, lenders, secondary markets, loan servicers, guaranty agency servicers, and collection agencies.


(2) IssuesThe Secretary shall provide for a comprehensive discussion and exchange of information concerning the implementation of this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 through such mechanisms as regional meetings and electronic exchanges of information. The Secretary shall take into account the information received through such mechanisms in the development of proposed regulations and shall publish a summary of such information in the Federal Register together with such proposed regulations.



(b) Draft regulations(1) In generalAfter obtaining the advice and recommendations described in subsection (a)(1) of this section and before publishing proposed regulations in the Federal Register, the Secretary shall prepare draft regulations implementing this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 and shall submit such regulations to a negotiated rulemaking process. Participants in the negotiations process shall be chosen by the Secretary from individuals nominated by groups described in subsection (a)(1) of this section, and shall include both representatives of such groups from Washington, D.C., and industry participants. The Secretary shall select individuals with demonstrated expertise or experience in the relevant subjects under negotiation, reflecting the diversity in the industry, representing both large and small participants, as well as individuals serving local areas and national markets. The negotiation process shall be conducted in a timely manner in order that the final regulations may be issued by the Secretary within the 360-day period described in section 1232(e) of this title.

All published proposed regulations shall conform to agreements resulting from such negotiated rulemaking unless the Secretary reopens the negotiated rulemaking process or provides a written explanation to the participants in that process why the Secretary has decided to depart from such agreements. Such negotiated rulemaking shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1), and the Secretary shall ensure that a clear and reliable record of agreements reached during the negotiations process is maintained.
