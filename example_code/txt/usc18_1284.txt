Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1934 ed., §§ 741 and 753e (Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 529, §§ 1, 4, 26 Stat. 839; May 14, 1930, ch. 274, § 6, 46 Stat. 326).
This section consolidates said sections 741 and 753e with such changes of language as were necessary to effect consolidation.
“The Classification Act, as amended,” was inserted more clearly to express the existing procedure for appointment of officers and employees as noted in letter of the Director of Bureau of Prisons, June 19, 1944.
