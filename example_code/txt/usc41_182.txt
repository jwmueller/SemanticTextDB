650441:37.June 30, 1936, ch. 881, § 3, 49 Stat. 2037.


In this section, the words “or firms” are omitted because of the definition of “person” in 41:41, restated in section 6501 of the revised title.
In subsection (a), the words “or violated” are added for consistency in the chapter.
In subsection (b), the words “contract described in section 6502 of this title” are substituted for “contracts” to clarify the scope of the prohibition. The words “the date of the determination by the Secretary that a breach or violation occurred” are substituted for “the date the Secretary of Labor determines such breach to have occurred” to clarify that the three-year period begins with the date of the Secretary’s determination and not with the date of the breach or violation. The words “or violation” are added for consistency in the chapter.
