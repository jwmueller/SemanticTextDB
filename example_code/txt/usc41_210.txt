§ 8105. Waiver(a) In General.—The head of an agency may waive a suspension of payments, termination of the contract or grant, or suspension or debarment of a contractor or grantee under this chapter with respect to a particular contract or grant if—(1) in the case of a contract, the head of the agency determines under section 8102(b)(1) of this title, after a final determination is issued under section 8102(b)(1), that suspension of payments, termination of the contract, suspension or debarment of the contractor, or refusal to permit a person to be treated as a responsible source for a contract would severely disrupt the operation of the agency to the detriment of the Federal Government or the general public; or

(2) in the case of a grant, the head of the agency determines that suspension of payments, termination of the grant, or suspension or debarment of the grantee would not be in the public interest.
