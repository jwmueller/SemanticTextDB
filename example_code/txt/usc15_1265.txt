“(b)(1) As part of his planning for the transfer of the ownership and operation of civil operational land remote sensing satellite systems to the private sector the Secretary shall—“(A) Conduct a study to define the current, projected, and potential needs of the government for land remote sensing data.

“(B) Determine and describe the equipment, software, and data inventory that could be transferred to the private sector.
