(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 759; Pub. L. 101–644, title I, § 106, Nov. 29, 1990, 104 Stat. 4665; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(U), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2148.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 305d of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians (Aug. 27, 1935, ch. 748, § 5, 49 Stat. 892).
The reference to the offense as a misdemeanor was omitted as unnecessary in view of the definition of misdemeanor in section 1 of this title.
The words “upon conviction thereof” were omitted as unnecessary, since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.
Maximum fine was changed from $2,000 to $500 to bring the offense within the category of petty offenses defined by section 1 of this title. (See reviser’s note under section 1157 of this title.)
Minor changes were made in phraseology.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $250,000” in third par.
1990—Pub. L. 101–644, in third par., added cls. (1) and (2), struck out “be fined not more than $500 or imprisoned not more than six months, or both; and” after “Shall”, and designated remaining provision at end as cl. (3).
