Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 753j, 908 (May 14, 1930, ch. 274, § 11, 46 Stat. 327; May 27, 1930, ch. 339, § 8, 46 Stat. 390).
Section consolidates sections 753j and 908 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. The section was broadened to include the taking or sending out of contraband from the institution. This was suggested by representatives of the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice. In other respects the section was rewritten without change of substance.
The words “narcotic”, “drug”, “weapon” and “contraband” were omitted, since the insertion of the words “contrary to any rule or regulation promulgated by the attorney general” preserves the intent of the original statutes.
Words “guilty of a felony” were deleted as unnecessary in view of definitive section 1 of this title. (See also reviser’s note under section 550 of this title.)
Minor verbal changes also were made.
