Codification
“Forest Service of the United States” substituted for “forest reserve of the United States” as the probable intent of Congress in that the federal forest reserves were transferred from Department of the Interior to Department of Agriculture by act Feb. 1, 1905, ch. 288, § 1, 33 Stat. 628, and administration of forest reserves was placed in Forest Service which was created by that act.
Words “national forests” and “forest” substituted for “forest reserves” and “reservation”, respectively, on authority of act Mar. 4, 1907, ch. 2907, 34 Stat. 1269, which provided that forest reserves shall hereafter be known as national forests.
That part of act Mar. 3, 1905, which related to arrests by employees of the National Park Service for violations of laws and regulations, was (prior to the amendment made by Pub. L 94–458) classified to section 10 of this title.

Amendments1976—Pub. L. 91–383, § 10(a)(2), as added Pub. L. 94–458, struck out “and national parks” after “national forests” and “or national park” after “jurisdiction the forest”.


Change of Name
“United States magistrate judge” substituted for “United States magistrate” wherever appearing in text pursuant to section 321 of Pub. L. 101–650, set out as a note under section 631 of Title 28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure. Previously, “United States magistrate” substituted for “United States commissioner” pursuant to Pub. L. 90–578. See chapter 43 (§ 631 et seq.) of Title 28.
