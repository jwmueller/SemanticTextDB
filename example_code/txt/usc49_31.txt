In subsection (a), the words “provisions of title 5 governing appointment in the competitive service” are substituted for “civil service laws” in 49:1657(o) for clarity and consistency. The words “as shall be appropriate for the purpose of” before “consultation” in 49:1657(o) are omitted as surplus. The words “the Secretary in carrying out the duties and powers of the Secretary” are substituted for “the Department in performance of its functions” in 49:1657(o) and “the Administration in performance of its functions hereunder” in 49:1343(g) for clarity and consistency because the duties and powers are vested in the Secretary of Transportation.
In subsection (b), the word “compensation” after “may be paid” in 49:1657(o) is omitted as surplus. The words “not more than $100 a day” are substituted for “at rates not exceeding those authorized for individuals under subsection (b) of this section” in 49:1657(o) for clarity because that is the rate under 49:1657(b).

In subsection (c), the words “A member of an advisory committee advising the Secretary” are substituted for “in the case of any individual” in 49:1343(g) for clarity. The words “may serve” are added for clarity and because of the restatement of the section. The words “in carrying out aviation duties and powers” are added because the source provisions being restated only applies to carrying out duties and powers related to the Federal Aviation Administration.
