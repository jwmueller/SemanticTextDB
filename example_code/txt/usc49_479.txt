In subsection (a), the words “impose” and “imposed” are substituted for “assessed”, for consistency in the revised title.
In subsection (a)(1), the first 2 sentences are substituted for 45:438(a) and (c) (1st sentence) for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “(including but not limited to a railroad; any manager, supervisor, official, or other employee or agent of a railroad; any owner, manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of railroad equipment, track, or facilities; any independent contractor providing goods or services to a railroad; and any employee of such owner, manufacturer, lessor, lessee, or independent contractor)” are omitted as surplus because of the definition of “person” in 1:1 and because the provision being violated indicates to whom it applies. The word “shall” in 45:438(c) (1st sentence) is retained from the source provisions. For a discussion of whether the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to impose a penalty is mandatory or permissive, see Railway Labor Executives’ Ass’n v. Dole, 760 F.2d 1021, 1024, 1025 (9th Cir. 1985); H.R. Conf. Rept. No. 100–637, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 20; 134 Cong. Rec. H3470, May 23, 1988 (daily ed.); 134 Cong. Rec. S7510, June 9, 1988 (daily ed.). See also 134 Cong. Rec. E1946, June 10, 1988 (daily ed.). For an extended discussion of FRA’s prosecutorial discretion, see Nationwide Rail Safety: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Transportation, Tourism, and Hazardous Materials of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 54–65 (1987). See also section 6 of this bill that provides that this bill restates, without substantive change, the provisions of law replaced by this bill, and that this bill may not be construed as making a substantive change in the law restated. Therefore, the word “shall” in this subsection has the same meaning it has under existing law. The words “A separate violation” are substituted for “a separate offense” for consistency.
In subsection (a)(3), the words “may compromise the amount . . . to not less than $500” are substituted for “may, however, be compromised . . . for any amount, but in no event for an amount less than the minimum provided in subsection (b) of this section” for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (B), the words “prior or subsequent” are omitted as unnecessary.
In subsection (c), the words “deposited in” are substituted for “covered into” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.
