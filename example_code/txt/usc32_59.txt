Notwithstanding section 8332(b) of title 5, United States Code, as amended by section 5 of this Act, the service under section 709 of title 32, United States Code, or prior corresponding provision of law, of a person who has made an election to remain covered by the employee retirement system of, or plan sponsored by, a State or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, shall not be creditable toward eligibility for or amount of annuity under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code. A person who retires pursuant to his valid election shall not be eligible for any rights, benefits, or privileges to which retired civilian employees of the United States may be entitled.”

“(c) Each technician on the effective date of this Act [see Effective Date note above], whose position is converted to the General Schedule set forth in section 5332 of title 5, United States Code, or to the appropriate prevailing rate schedule, as applicable, who prior to the initial adjustment of his rate of basic compensation under subsection (a) of this section, has earned, but has not been credited with, an increase in that rate, shall be granted credit for such increase before his rate of basic compensation is initially adjusted under that subsection.

“(d) Each technician on the effective date of this Act whose position is converted to the General Schedule set forth in section 5332 of title 5, United States Code, or to the appropriate prevailing rate schedule, as applicable, shall be granted credit, for purposes of his first step increase under the General Schedule or prevailing rate schedule, for all satisfactory service performed by him since his last increase in compensation prior to the initial adjustment of his rate of basic compensation under subsection (a) of this section.

“(e) An increase in rate of basic compensation by reason of the enactment of subsection (a) of this section shall not be considered to be an equivalent increase with respect to step increases for technicians whose positions are converted to the General Schedule set forth in section 5332 of title 5, United States Code, or the appropriate prevailing rate schedule under authority of this section.”
