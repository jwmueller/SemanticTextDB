In paragraph (2), the words “but shall not be limited to” are omitted as unnecessary.
In paragraph (4)(B), the words “become or remain” are substituted for “be placed under or continued to be” for clarity.
In paragraph (5)(B)(i), the words “individual who is a citizen of the United States” are substituted for “individual who is a citizen or national of the United States or a citizen of the Northern Mariana Islands” in 46 App. U.S.C. 1271(k) because of the definition of “citizen of the United States” in chapter 1 of the revised title. Citizens of the Northern Mariana Islands became citizens or non-citizen nationals of the United States (either of which is a “citizen of the United States” as defined in chapter 1 of the revised title) when the Covenant establishing the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands became effective on November 4, 1986.
In paragraph (5)(B)(ii), the words “corporation, partnership, association, or other” are omitted as suplus [sic]. The words “the term ‘State’ as used therein includes any State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands of the United States, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, or any other Commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States” in 46 App. U.S.C. 1271(k) are omitted as unnecessary because of the definitions of “State” and “United States” in chapter 1 of the revised title. The definition of “United States” in 46 App. U.S.C. 1271(m) is omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of “United States” in chapter 1. The words “and nationals of the United States or citizens of the Northern Mariana Islands shall be treated as citizens of the United States in meeting such ownership requirement” are omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of “citizen of the United States” in chapter 1 of the revised title.
In paragraph (8), before subparagraph (A), the words “instrument of indebtedness” are substituted for “note, bond, debenture, or other evidence of indebtedness” to eliminate unnecessary words. In subparagraph (B), the reference to section 53717 is substituted for the reference to 46 App. U.S.C. 1272 because the accounts under section 53717 replace the Federal Ship Financing Fund. See the explanation for section 53717.
