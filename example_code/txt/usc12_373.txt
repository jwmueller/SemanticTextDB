(b) Issuance of authorization to Bank to provide guarantees, insurance, and credits to competing United States sellersThe Secretary of the Treasury shall issue such authorization to the Bank to provide guarantees, insurance, and credits to competing United States sellers, unless the Secretary determines that—(1) the availability of foreign official noncompetitive financing is not likely to be a significant factor in the sale; or

(2) the foreign noncompetitive financing has been withdrawn.


(c) Provision of financing by Bank pursuant to authorizationUpon receipt of authorization by the Secretary of the Treasury, the Export-Import Bank may provide financing to match that offered by the foreign official export credit entity: Provided, however, That loans, guarantees and insurance provided under this authority shall conform to all provisions of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, as amended [12 U.S.C. 635 et seq.].
