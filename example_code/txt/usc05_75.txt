“SEC. 202. FINDINGS.“Congress finds that—“(1) a vibrant and growing small business sector is critical to creating jobs in a dynamic economy;

“(2) small businesses bear a disproportionate share of regulatory costs and burdens;

“(3) fundamental changes that are needed in the regulatory and enforcement culture of Federal agencies to make agencies more responsive to small business can be made without compromising the statutory missions of the agencies;

“(4) three of the top recommendations of the 1995 White House Conference on Small Business involve reforms to the way government regulations are developed and enforced, and reductions in government paperwork requirements;

“(5) the requirements of chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code, have too often been ignored by government agencies, resulting in greater regulatory burdens on small entities than necessitated by statute; and

“(6) small entities should be given the opportunity to seek judicial review of agency actions required by chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code.
