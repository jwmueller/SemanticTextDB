Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “principal” in section 2 of this title.
Words “motor vehicle or aircraft” were inserted in third paragraph to remove any doubt as to scope of section in view of rapidly advancing methods of transportation.
Minor changes were made in phraseology.

Amendments1996—Pub. L. 104–294 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $1,000” in fourth par.
