References in TextThe date of enactment of this section, referred to in subsec. (a), is the date of enactment of Pub. L. 110–246, which was approved June 18, 2008.
Section 8605 of this title, referred to in subsec. (e), was in the original “section 9008(d) of the Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000 (7 U.S.C. 8605)”, and was translated as meaning section 306 of title III of Pub. L. 106–224, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because title III of Pub. L. 106–224, known as the Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000, does not contain a section 9008 and section 306 of the Act related to the establishment of the Biomass Research and Development Technical Advisory Committee, prior to repeal by Pub. L. 110–246, title IX, § 9001(b), June 18, 2008, 122 Stat. 2095.
