(2) in equal shares to, or on behalf of, the surviving children eligible for the annuity at the time each payment is due, ending when there is no surviving eligible child; or

(3) to, or on behalf of, the surviving spouse, and after the death of that spouse or the remarriage of that spouse before age 60, in equal shares to, or on behalf of, the surviving eligible children, ending when there is no surviving eligible child.

For the purposes of the preceding sentence, a child (other than a child who is incapable of supporting himself because of a mental defect or physical incapacity existing before his eighteenth birthday) who is at least eighteen, but under twenty-three years of age, and who is not pursuing a course of study or training defined in section 1435 of this title, shall be considered an eligible beneficiary unless the Secretary concerned approves an application submitted by the member under section 1436(b)(4) of this title. An election of an annuity under clause (3) of subsection (a) shall provide that no deduction may be made from the elector’s retired or retainer pay after the last day of the month in which there is no eligible spouse because of death or divorce.
