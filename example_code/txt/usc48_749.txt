Over this fifteen-year period, the Government of the Marshall Islands shall dedicate an average of no less than 40 percent of these amounts to the capital account subject to provision for revision of this percentage incorporated into the plan referred to in Section 211(b); and

“(2) to the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia, $60 million annually for five years commencing on the effective date of this Compact, $51 million annually for five years commencing on the fifth anniversary of the effective date of this Compact, and $40 million annually for five years commencing on the tenth anniversary of the effective date of this Compact. Over this fifteen year period, the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia shall dedicate an average of no less than 40 percent of these amounts annually to the capital account subject to provision for revision of this percentage incorporated into the plan referred to in Section 211(b). To take into account the special nature of the assistance, to be provided under this paragraph and Sections 212(b), 213(c), 214(c), 215(a)(3), 215(b)(3), 216(a), 216(b), 221(a), and 221(b), the division of these amounts among the national and state governments of the Federated States of Micronesia shall be certified to the Government of the United States by the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia.


“(b) The annual expenditure of the grant amounts specified for the capital account in Section 211(a) by the Governments of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia shall be in accordance with official overall economic development plans provided by those Governments and concurred in by the Government of the United States prior to the effective date of this Compact. These plans may be amended from time to time by the Government of the Marshall Islands or the Federated States of Micronesia.

“(c) The Government of the United States and the Governments of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia recognize that the achievement of the goals of the plans referred to in Section 211(b) depends upon the availability of adequate internal revenue as well as economic assistance from sources outside of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia, including the Government of the United States, and may, in addition, be affected by the impact of exceptional economically adverse circumstances. Each of the Governments of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia shall therefore report annually to the President of the United States and to the Congress of the United States on the implementation of the plans and on their use of the funds specified in this Article. These reports shall outline the achievements of the plans to date and the need, if any, for an additional authorization and appropriation of economic assistance for that year to account for any exceptional, economically adverse circumstances. It is understood that the Government of the United States cannot be committed by this Section to seek or support such additional economic assistance.
