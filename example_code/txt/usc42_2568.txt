“SEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAM.“(a) In General.—The Secretary, in consultation and cooperation with the Participating States, the water resources research institutes, Sandia National Laboratories, and other appropriate entities in the United States and Mexico, and the IBWC, as appropriate, shall carry out the United States-Mexico transboundary aquifer assessment program to characterize, map, and model priority transboundary aquifers along the United States-Mexico border at a level of detail determined to be appropriate for the particular aquifer.

“(b) Objectives.—The objectives of the program are to—“(1) develop and implement an integrated scientific approach to identify and assess priority transboundary aquifers, including—“(A) for purposes of subsection (c)(2), specifying priority transboundary aquifers for further analysis by assessing—“(i) the proximity of a proposed priority transboundary aquifer to areas of high population density;

“(ii) the extent to which a proposed priority transboundary aquifer would be used;

“(iii) the susceptibility of a proposed priority transboundary aquifer to contamination; and

“(iv) any other relevant criteria;


“(B) evaluating all available data and publications as part of the development of study plans for each priority transboundary aquifer;

“(C) creating a new, or enhancing an existing, geographic information system database to characterize the spatial and temporal aspects of each priority transboundary aquifer; and

“(D) using field studies, including support for and expansion of ongoing monitoring and metering efforts, to develop—“(i) the additional data necessary to adequately define aquifer characteristics; and

“(ii) scientifically sound groundwater flow models to assist with State and local water management and administration, including modeling of relevant groundwater and surface water interactions;



“(2) consider the expansion or modification of existing agreements, as appropriate, between the United States Geological Survey, the Participating States, the water resources research institutes, and appropriate authorities in the United States and Mexico, to—“(A) conduct joint scientific investigations;

“(B) archive and share relevant data; and

“(C) carry out any other activities consistent with the program; and


“(3) produce scientific products for each priority transboundary aquifer that—“(A) are capable of being broadly distributed; and

“(B) provide the scientific information needed by water managers and natural resource agencies on both sides of the United States-Mexico border to effectively accomplish the missions of the managers and agencies.



“(c) Designation of Priority Transboundary Aquifers.—“(1) In general.—For purposes of the program, the Secretary shall designate as priority transboundary aquifers—“(A) the Hueco Bolson and Mesilla aquifers underlying parts of Texas, New Mexico, and Mexico;

“(B) the Santa Cruz River Valley aquifers underlying Arizona and Sonora, Mexico; and

“(C) the San Pedro aquifers underlying Arizona and Sonora, Mexico.


“(2) Additional aquifers.—The Secretary may, using the criteria under subsection (b)(1)(A), evaluate and designate additional priority transboundary aquifers which underlie New Mexico or Texas.


“(d) Cooperation With Mexico.—To ensure a comprehensive assessment of priority transboundary aquifers, the Secretary shall, to the maximum extent practicable, work with appropriate Federal agencies and other organizations to develop partnerships with, and receive input from, relevant organizations in Mexico to carry out the program.

“(e) Grants and Cooperative Agreements.—The Secretary may provide grants or enter into cooperative agreements and other agreements with the water resources research institutes and other Participating State entities to carry out the program.
