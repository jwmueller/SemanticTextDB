(ii) the domestic industry experiences an orderly transfer of resources to other productive pursuits; and


(B) dislocated workers in the industry experience an orderly transition to productive pursuits.


(2) The domestic industry may be considered to have made a positive adjustment to import competition even though the industry is not of the same size and composition as the industry at the time the investigation was initiated under section 2252(b) of this title.
