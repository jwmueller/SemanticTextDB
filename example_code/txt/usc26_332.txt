(2) such exchange is not in pursuance of a plan of reorganization,


section 311 shall apply to any transfer in such exchange by the controlled corporation in the same manner as if such transfer were a distribution to which subpart A of part I applies.

(ii) such nonqualified preferred stock shall be treated as other property for purposes of applying subsection (b).



(2) Nonqualified preferred stockFor purposes of paragraph (1)—(A) In generalThe term “nonqualified preferred stock” means preferred stock if—(i) the holder of such stock has the right to require the issuer or a related person to redeem or purchase the stock,

(ii) the issuer or a related person is required to redeem or purchase such stock,

(iii) the issuer or a related person has the right to redeem or purchase the stock and, as of the issue date, it is more likely than not that such right will be exercised, or

(iv) the dividend rate on such stock varies in whole or in part (directly or indirectly) with reference to interest rates, commodity prices, or other similar indices.


(B) LimitationsClauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of subparagraph (A) shall apply only if the right or obligation referred to therein may be exercised within the 20-year period beginning on the issue date of such stock and such right or obligation is not subject to a contingency which, as of the issue date, makes remote the likelihood of the redemption or purchase.


(C) Exceptions for certain rights or obligations(i) In generalA right or obligation shall not be treated as described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of subparagraph (A) if—(I) it may be exercised only upon the death, disability, or mental incompetency of the holder, or

(II) in the case of a right or obligation to redeem or purchase stock transferred in connection with the performance of services for the issuer or a related person (and which represents reasonable compensation), it may be exercised only upon the holder’s separation from service from the issuer or a related person.


(ii) ExceptionClause (i)(I) shall not apply if the stock relinquished in the exchange, or the stock acquired in the exchange is in—(I) a corporation if any class of stock in such corporation or a related party is readily tradable on an established securities market or otherwise, or

(II) any other corporation if such exchange is part of a transaction or series of transactions in which such corporation is to become a corporation described in subclause (I).




(3) DefinitionsFor purposes of this subsection—(A) Preferred stockThe term “preferred stock” means stock which is limited and preferred as to dividends and does not participate in corporate growth to any significant extent. Stock shall not be treated as participating in corporate growth to any significant extent unless there is a real and meaningful likelihood of the shareholder actually participating in the earnings and growth of the corporation. If there is not a real and meaningful likelihood that dividends beyond any limitation or preference will actually be paid, the possibility of such payments will be disregarded in determining whether stock is limited and preferred as to dividends.


(B) Related personA person shall be treated as related to another person if they bear a relationship to such other person described in section 267(b) or 707(b).



(4) RegulationsThe Secretary may prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this subsection and sections 354(a)(2)(C), 355(a)(3)(D), and 356(e).
