Revolving FundsThe revolving fund established by this section (in effect immediately before January 6, 1988), referred to in text, means the revolving fund created by former provisions of this section, which merged the revolving fund established by Public Law 87–343, 75 Stat. 758, as amended (described below as “first fund”), with the revolving fund established by Public Law 87–494, 76 Stat. 109, as amended (described below as “second fund”), which was regarded as continued by Pub. L. 96–592.
At the time of enactment of former section 2152 of this title (see second par. of note under former section 2152 of this title) by Pub. L. 92–181 funds for temporary investment by the Governor of the Farm Credit Administration in the farm credit system were available from two revolving funds.
The first fund, providing moneys for investment in production credit associations and intermediate credit banks, was covered by former section 1131i of this title. Such fund was itself the result of an earlier merger of two revolving funds, the first having been created by the Farm Credit Act of 1933 and the second having been created by the Federal Farm Mortgage Corporation Act of 1934. These two were combined into a single fund pursuant to Pub. L. 87–343, § 2(1), Oct. 3, 1961, 75 Stat. 758. Each of the statutory steps in the establishment of such fund was cast in the form of an amendment to the Farm Credit Act of 1933. Since such Farm Credit Act of 1933 has been repealed by section 5.26 of Pub. L. 92–181, section 1131i of this title is carried as repealed. Notwithstanding such apparent repeal, statements of Congressional intent indicate an intention to retain the fund using as its statutory base the law (Pub. L. 87–343) which had effected the consolidation in 1961.
The second fund, providing moneys for investment in banks for cooperatives, is covered by section 1141d of this title. Although the basic authority for such fund would be the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929, a more updated authority for such fund is the Agricultural Marketing Act Amendment of 1962, Pub. L. 87–494, June 25, 1962, 76 Stat. 109, under which the fund was reduced to $150,000,000 and the amount in such fund in excess of such figure was returned to the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.
Pub. L. 96–592, referred to above as continuing the revolving fund established by Pub. L. 87–494, is the Farm Credit Act Amendment of 1980, Pub. L. 96–592, Dec. 24, 1980, 94 Stat. 3437. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title of 1980 Amendment note set out under section 2001 of this title and Tables.
