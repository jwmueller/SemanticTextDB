§ 4054. Former spouses(a) Living Service members(1) Unless otherwise expressly provided by any spousal agreement or court order under section 4060(b)(1) of this title, a former spouse of a participant or former participant is entitled to an annuity if such former spouse was married to the participant for at least 10 years during service of the participant which is creditable under this subchapter with at least 5 of such years occurring while the participant was a member of the Foreign Service and—(A) if married to the participant throughout the creditable service of the participant, equal to 50 percent of the annuity of the participant; or

(B) if not married to the participant throughout such creditable service, equal to that former spouse’s pro rata share of 50 percent of such annuity.


For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “creditable service” means service which is creditable under part I or II of this subchapter.

(2) A former spouse shall not be qualified for an annuity under this subsection if before the commencement of that annuity the former spouse remarries before becoming 60 years of age.

(3) The annuity of a former spouse under this subsection commences on the later of the day the participant upon whose service the annuity is based becomes entitled to an annuity under this part or the first day of the month in which the divorce or annulment involved becomes final. The annuity of such former spouse and the right thereto terminate on—(A) the last day of the month before the former spouse dies or remarries before 60 years of age; or

(B) the date the annuity of the participant terminates (except in the case of an annuity subject to paragraph (5)(B)).


(4) No spousal agreement or court order under section 4060(b)(1) of this title involving any participant may provide for an annuity or any combination of annuities under this subsection which exceeds the annuity of the participant, nor may any such court order relating to an annuity under this subsection be given effect if it is issued more than 24 months after the date the divorce or annulment involved becomes final.

(5)(A) The annuity payable to any participant shall be reduced by the amount of an annuity under this subsection paid to any former spouse based upon the service of that participant. Such reduction shall be disregarded in calculating the survivor annuity for any spouse, former spouse, or other survivor under this part, and in calculating any reduction in the annuity of the participant to provide survivor benefits under subsection (b) of this section or section 4046(b)(3) of this title.

(B) If any annuitant whose annuity is reduced under subparagraph (A) is recalled to service under section 3948 of this title, or reinstated or reappointed in the Service in the case of a recovered disability annuitant or if any annuitant is reemployed as provided for under section 4064 of this title, the salary of that annuitant shall be reduced by the same amount as the annuity would have been reduced if it had continued. Amounts equal to the reductions under this subparagraph shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Fund.


(6) Notwithstanding paragraph (3), in the case of any former spouse of a disability annuitant—(A) the annuity of that former spouse shall commence on the date the participant would qualify on the basis of his or her creditable service for an annuity under this part (other than a disability annuity) or the date the disability annuity begins, whichever is later, and

(B) the amount of the annuity of the former spouse shall be calculated on the basis of the annuity for which the participant would otherwise so qualify.


(7) An annuity under this subsection shall be treated the same as a survivor annuity under subsection (b) of this section for purposes of section 4046(h) of this title or any comparable provision of law.


(b) Deceased Service members(1) Subject to any election under section 4046(b)(1)(C) of this title and unless otherwise expressly provided by any spousal agreement or court order under section 4060(b)(1) of this title, if a former participant who is entitled to receive an annuity is survived by a former spouse, the former spouse shall be entitled to a survivor annuity—(A) if married to the participant throughout the creditable service of the participant, equal to 55 percent of the full amount of the participant’s annuity, as computed under section 4046(a) of this title; or

(B) if not married to the participant throughout such creditable service, equal to that former spouse’s pro rata share of 55 percent of the full amount of such annuity.


For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “creditable service” means service which is creditable under part I or II of this subchapter.

(2) A former spouse shall not be qualified for an annuity under this subsection if before the commencement of that annuity the former spouse remarries before becoming 60 years of age.

(3) An annuity payable from the Fund under this part to a surviving former spouse under this subsection shall commence on the day after the annuitant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the month before the former spouse’s death or remarriage before attaining age 60. If such a survivor annuity is terminated because of remarriage, it shall be restored at the same rate commencing on the date such remarriage is terminated if any lump sum paid upon termination of the annuity is returned to the Fund.

(4)(A) The maximum survivor annuity or combination of survivor annuities under this section (and section 4046(b)(3) of this title) with respect to any participant or former participant may not exceed 55 percent of the full amount of the participant’s annuity, as calculated under section 4046(a) of this title.

(B) Once a survivor annuity has been provided for under this subsection for any former spouse, a survivor annuity may thereafter be provided for under this subsection (or section 4046(b)(3) of this title) with respect to a participant or former participant only for that portion (if any) of the maximum available which is not committed for survivor benefits for any former spouse whose prospective right to such annuity has not terminated by reason of death or remarriage.

(C) After the death of a participant or former participant, a court order under section 4060(b)(1) of this title may not adjust the amount of the annuity of any former spouse under this section.


(5)(A) For each full month after a former spouse of a participant or former participant dies or remarries before attaining age 60, the annuity of the participant, if reduced to provide a survivor annuity for that former spouse, shall be recomputed and paid as if the annuity had not been so reduced, unless an election is in effect under subparagraph (B).

(B) Subject to paragraph (4)(B), the participant may elect in writing within one year after receipt of notice of the death or remarriage of the former spouse to continue the reduction in order to provide a higher survivor annuity under section 4046(b)(3) of this title for any spouse of the participant.



(c) Additional survivor annuity(1) In the case of any participant or former participant providing a survivor annuity benefit under subsection (b) of this section for a former spouse—(A) such participant may elect, or

(B) a spousal agreement or court order under section 4060(b)(1) of this title may provide for,


an additional survivor annuity under this subsection for any other former spouse or spouse surviving the participant, if the participant satisfactorily passes a physical examination as prescribed by the Secretary of State.

(2) Neither the total amount of survivor annuity or annuities under this subsection with respect to any participant or former participant, nor the survivor annuity or annuities for any one surviving spouse or former spouse of such participant under this section and section 4046 of this title, shall exceed 55 percent of the full amount of the participant’s annuity, as computed under section 4046(a) of this title.

(3)(A) In accordance with regulations which the Secretary of State shall prescribe, the participant involved may provide for any annuity under this subsection—(i) by a reduction in the annuity or an allotment from the salary of the participant,

(ii) by a lump sum payment or installment payments to the Fund, or

(iii) by any combination thereof.


(B) The present value of the total amount to accrue to the Fund under subparagraph (A) to provide any annuity under this subsection shall be actuarially equivalent in value to such annuity, as calculated upon such tables of mortality as may from time to time be prescribed for this purpose by the Secretary of State.

(C) If a former spouse predeceases the participant or remarries before attaining age 60 (or, in the case of a spouse, the spouse does not qualify as a former spouse upon dissolution of the marriage)—(i) if an annuity reduction or salary allotment under subparagraph (A) is in effect for that spouse or former spouse, the annuity shall be recomputed and paid as if it had not been reduced or the salary allotment terminated, as the case may be, and

(ii) any amount accruing to the Fund under subparagraph (A) shall be refunded, but only to the extent that such amount may have exceeded the actuarial cost of providing benefits under this subsection for the period such benefits were provided, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of State.


(D) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of State, an annuity shall be recomputed (or salary allotment terminated or adjusted), and a refund provided (if appropriate), in a manner comparable to that provided under subparagraph (C), in order to reflect a termination or reduction of future benefits under this subsection for a spouse in the event a former spouse of the participant dies or remarries before attaining age 60 and an increased annuity is provided for that spouse in accordance with this part.


(4) An annuity payable under this subsection to a spouse or former spouse shall commence on the day after the participant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the month before the former spouse’s death or remarriage before attaining age 60.

(5) Section 4066 of this title shall not apply to any annuity under this subsection, unless authorized under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of State.
