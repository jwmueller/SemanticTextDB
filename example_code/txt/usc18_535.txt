Historical and Revision NotesBased on subsections (a) pars. (2)–(5), (7), (b), and (d) of section 746 of Title 8, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Aliens and Nationality (Oct. 14, 1940, ch. 876, § 346(a), pars. (2)–(5), (7), (b), (d), 54 Stat. 1163, 1164, 1167).
Section consolidates five similar paragraphs, and the punishment provisions of subsection (d) of said section 746 of title 8, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Aliens and Nationality, with minor necessary changes in translations and phraseology. Numerous references to aiding and assisting were omitted as unnecessary as such persons are principals under definitive section 2 of this title.
Words “a certificate of arrival or” were inserted before “any certificate” in subsection (b), so as to remove any doubt as to scope of section.
