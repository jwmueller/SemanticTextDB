References in TextFor definition of “this chapter”, referred to in subsecs. (a), (b)(1), (c), (f)(1)(B), and (g)(1), see note set out under section 1921 of this title.
Section 1989 of this title, referred to in subsec. (f)(1)(A), was in the original “section 114”, and was translated as meaning section 339 of Pub. L. 87–128, which is classified to section 1989 of this title, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because Pub. L. 87–128 does not contain a section 114 and section 1989 provides for a lender certification program.
