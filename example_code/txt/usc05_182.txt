In paragraph (2), the words “a military department” are substituted for “the War Department or Navy Department” (appearing in section 2 of the Act of June 27, 1944) because of the definition of “military department” in section 102. The Department of War was designated the Department of the Army by the Act of July 26, 1947, ch. 343, § 205, 61 Stat. 501. “Department of the Air Force” is included on authority of the Act of July 26, 1947, ch. 343, § 207 (a), (f), 61 Stat. 502.
