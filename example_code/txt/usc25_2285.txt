“SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.“(a) Findings.—Congress finds that—“(1) despite the availability of abundant natural resources on Indian lands and a rich cultural legacy that accords great value to self-determination, self-reliance, and independence, Native Americans suffer rates of unemployment, poverty, poor health, substandard housing, and associated social ills which are greater than the rates for any other group in the United States;

“(2) the capacity of Indian tribes to build strong Indian tribal governments and vigorous economies is hindered by the inability of Indian tribes to engage communities that surround Indian lands and outside investors in economic activities conducted on Indian lands;

“(3) beginning in 1970, with the issuance by the Nixon Administration of a special message to Congress on Indian Affairs, each President has reaffirmed the special government-to-government relationship between Indian tribes and the United States; and

“(4) the United States has an obligation to assist Indian tribes with the creation of appropriate economic and political conditions with respect to Indian lands to—“(A) encourage investment from outside sources that do not originate with the Indian tribes; and

“(B) facilitate economic development on Indian lands.



“(b) Purposes.—The purposes of this Act are as follows:“(1) To provide for a comprehensive review of the laws (including regulations) that affect investment and business decisions concerning activities conducted on Indian lands.

“(2) To determine the extent to which those laws unnecessarily or inappropriately impair—“(A) investment and business development on Indian lands; or

“(B) the financial stability and management efficiency of Indian tribal governments.


“(3) To establish an authority to conduct the review under paragraph (1) and report findings and recommendations that result from the review to Congress and the President.
