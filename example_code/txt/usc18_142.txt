Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 54 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 21, 35 Stat. 1092).
Scope of section was enlarged to cover all possessions of the United States. When the section was first enacted in 1861 there were no possessions, and hence the use of the words “State or Territory” was sufficient to describe the area then subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The word “District” was inserted by the codifiers of the 1909 Criminal Code.

Amendments2002—Pub. L. 107–273 substituted “under this title” for “not more than $5,000”.
