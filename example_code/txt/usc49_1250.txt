§ 47141. Compatible land use planning and projects by State and local governments(a) In General.—The Secretary of Transportation may make grants, from amounts set aside under section 47117(e)(1)(A), to States and units of local government for development and implementation of land use compatibility plans and implementation of land use compatibility projects resulting from those plans for the purposes of making the use of land areas around large hub airports and medium hub airports compatible with aircraft operations. The Secretary may make a grant under this section for a land use compatibility plan or a project resulting from such plan only if—(1) the airport operator has not submitted a noise compatibility program to the Secretary under section 47504 or has not updated such program within the preceding 10 years; and

(2) the land use plan or project meets the requirements of this section.


(b) Eligibility.—In order to receive a grant under this section, a State or unit of local government must—(1) have the authority to plan and adopt land use control measures, including zoning, in the planning area in and around a large or medium hub airport;

(2) enter into an agreement with the airport owner or operator that the development of the land use compatibility plan will be done cooperatively; and

(3) provide written assurance to the Secretary that it will achieve, to the maximum extent possible, compatible land uses consistent with Federal land use compatibility criteria under section 47502(3) and that those compatible land uses will be maintained.


(c) Assurances.—The Secretary shall require a State or unit of local government to which a grant may be made under this section for a land use plan or a project resulting from such plan to provide—(1) assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that the plan—(A) is reasonably consistent with the goal of reducing existing noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses;

(B) addresses ways to achieve and maintain compatible land uses, including zoning, building codes, and any other land use compatibility measures under section 47504(a)(2) that are within the authority of the State or unit of local government to implement;

(C) uses noise contours provided by the airport operator that are consistent with the airport operation and planning, including any noise abatement measures adopted by the airport operator as part of its own noise mitigation efforts;

(D) does not duplicate, and is not inconsistent with, the airport operator’s noise compatibility measures for the same area; and

(E) has been approved jointly by the airport owner or operator and the State or unit of local government; and


(2) such other assurances as the Secretary determines to be necessary to carry out this section.


(d) Guidelines.—The Secretary shall establish guidelines to administer this section in accordance with the purposes and conditions described in this section. The Secretary may require a State or unit of local government to which a grant may be made under this section to provide progress reports and other information as the Secretary determines to be necessary to carry out this section.

(e) Eligible Projects.—The Secretary may approve a grant under this section to a State or unit of local government for a project resulting from a land use compatibility plan only if the Secretary is satisfied that the project is consistent with the guidelines established by the Secretary under this section, the State or unit of local government has provided the assurances required by this section, the State or unit of local government has implemented (or has made provision to implement) those elements of the plan that are not eligible for Federal financial assistance, and that the project is not inconsistent with applicable Federal Aviation Administration standards.

(f) Sunset.—This section shall not be in effect after September 30, 2015.

“(a) In General.—Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act [Feb. 14, 2012], the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall establish a pilot program under which operators of up to 4 public-use airports may receive grants for activities related to the redevelopment of airport properties in accordance with the requirements of this section.

“(b) Grants.—Under the pilot program, the Administrator may make a grant in a fiscal year, from funds made available for grants under section 47117(e)(1)(A) of title 49, United States Code, to an airport operator for a project—“(1) to support joint planning, engineering, design, and environmental permitting of projects, including the assembly and redevelopment of property purchased with noise mitigation funds made available under section 48103 of such title or passenger facility revenue collected under section 40117 of such title; and

“(2) to encourage airport-compatible land uses and generate economic benefits to the local airport authority and adjacent community.


“(c) Eligibility.—An airport operator shall be eligible to participate in the pilot program if—“(1) the operator has received approval for a noise compatibility program under section 47504 of such title; and

“(2) the operator demonstrates, as determined by the Administrator—“(A) a readiness to implement cooperative land use management and redevelopment plans with neighboring local jurisdictions; and

“(B) the probability of a clear economic benefit to neighboring local jurisdictions and financial return to the airport through the implementation of those plans.

“(e) Partnership With Neighboring Local Jurisdictions.—An airport operator shall use grant funds made available under the pilot program only in partnership with neighboring local jurisdictions.

“(f) Grant Requirements.—The Administrator may not make a grant to an airport operator under the pilot program unless the grant is—“(1) made to enable the airport operator and local jurisdictions undertaking community redevelopment efforts to expedite those efforts;

“(2) subject to a requirement that the local jurisdiction governing the property interests subject to the redevelopment efforts has adopted and will continue in effect zoning regulations that permit airport-compatible redevelopment; and

“(3) subject to a requirement that, in determining the part of the proceeds from disposing of land that is subject to repayment and reinvestment requirements under section 47107(c)(2)(A) of such title, the total amount of a grant issued under the pilot program that is attributable to the redevelopment of such land shall be added to other amounts that must be repaid or reinvested under that section upon disposal of such land by the airport operator.


“(g) Exceptions to Repayment and Reinvestment Requirements.—Amounts paid to the Secretary of Transportation under subsection (f)(3)—“(1) shall be available to the Secretary for, giving preference to the actions in descending order—“(A) reinvestment in an approved noise compatibility project at the applicable airport;

“(2) Allowable costs.—In determining the allowable costs, the Administrator shall deduct from the total costs of the activities described in subsection (b) that portion of the costs which is equal to that portion of the total property to be redeveloped under this section that is not owned or to be acquired by the airport operator pursuant to the noise compatibility program or that is not owned by the affected neighboring local jurisdictions or other public entities.


“(i) Maximum Amount.—Not more than $5,000,000 of the funds made available for grants under section 47117(e)(1)(A) of such title may be expended under the pilot program for any single public-use airport.

“(j) Use of Passenger Revenue.—An airport operator participating in the pilot program may use passenger facility revenue collected under section 40117 of such title to pay any project cost described in subsection (b) that is not financed by a grant under the pilot program.
