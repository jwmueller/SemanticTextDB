(ii) such State’s effort factor described in paragraph (2); multiplied by

(iii) 1.30 minus such State’s equity factor described in paragraph (3).


(B) State minimumNotwithstanding any other provision of this section or section 6332 of this title, from the total amount available for any fiscal year to carry out this section, each State shall be allotted at least the lesser of—(i) 0.35 percent of total appropriations; or

The effort factor determined under this sentence shall be a fraction the numerator of which is the product of the 3-year average per-pupil expenditure in the State multiplied by the 3-year average per capita income in the United States and the denominator of which is the product of the 3-year average per capita income in such State multiplied by the 3-year average per-pupil expenditure in the United States.
