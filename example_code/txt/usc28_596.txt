(R.S. §§ 823, 848; Apr. 26, 1926, ch. 183, § 3, 44 Stat. 324; May 17, 1932, ch. 190, 47 Stat. 158; June 25, 1936, ch. 804, 49 Stat. 1921; Feb. 10, 1939, ch. 2, § 1115(a), 53 Stat. 160; Dec. 24, 1942, ch. 825, § 1, 56 Stat. 1088.

Senate Revision AmendmentBy Senate amendments, all provisions relating to the Tax Court were eliminated. Therefore, as finally enacted, section 1115(a) of Title 26, U.S.C., Internal Revenue Code, was not one of the sources of this section. However, no change in the text of this section was necessary. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.
