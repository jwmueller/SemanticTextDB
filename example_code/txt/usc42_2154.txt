(b) AffordabilityA homeownership program under this subchapter shall provide for the establishment of sales prices (including principal, insurance, taxes, and interest and closing costs) for initial acquisition of the property from the public housing agency if the applicant is not a public housing agency, and for sales to eligible families, such that an eligible family shall not be required to expend more than 30 percent of the adjusted income of the family per month to complete a sale under the homeownership program.

(d) Acquisition and rehabilitation limitationsAcquisition or rehabilitation of public housing projects under a homeownership program under this subchapter may not consist of acquisition or rehabilitation of less than the whole public housing project in a project consisting of more than 1 building. The provisions of this subsection may be waived upon a finding by the Secretary that the sale of less than all the buildings in a project is feasible and will not result in a hardship to any tenants of the project who are not included in the homeownership program.

(B) neither the Federal Government nor the public housing agency will be exposed to undue risks related to action that may have to be taken pursuant to paragraph (3);

(C) any debt obligation can be serviced from project income, including operating assistance; and

(D) the proceeds of such encumbrance will be used only to meet housing standards in accordance with subsection (f) of this section or to make such additional capital improvements as the Secretary determines to be consistent with the purposes of this subchapter.


(3) Opportunity to cureAny lender that provides financing in connection with a homeownership program under this subchapter shall give the public housing agency, resident management corporation, individual owner, or other appropriate entity a reasonable opportunity to cure a financial default before foreclosing on the property, or taking other action as a result of the default.



(f) Housing quality standardsThe application shall include a plan ensuring that the unit—(1) will be free from any defects that pose a danger to health or safety before transfer of an ownership interest in, or shares representing, a unit to an eligible family; and

(2) will, not later than 2 years after the transfer to an eligible family, meet minimum housing standards established by the Secretary for the purposes of this subchapter.

(3) Relocation assistanceThe recipient shall also inform each such tenant that if the tenant chooses to move, the recipient will pay relocation assistance in accordance with the approved homeownership program.

References in TextThe National Housing Act, referred to in subsec. (e)(1), is act June 27, 1934, ch. 847, 48 Stat. 1246, as amended. Title II of the Act is classified principally to subchapter II (§ 1707 et seq.) of chapter 13 of Title 12, Banks and Banking. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see section 1701 of Title 12 and Tables.
This subchapter, referred to in subsec. (e)(3), was in the original “this subtitle”, and was translated as reading “this title”, meaning title III of act Sept. 1, 1937, ch. 896, as added by Pub. L. 101–625, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because title III of act Sept. 1, 1937, does not contain subtitles.
