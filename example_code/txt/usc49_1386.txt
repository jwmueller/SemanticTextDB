In subsection (a)(1), the words “may designate” are substituted for “is empowered to authorize, or designate” in 49 App.:783 (1st sentence) to eliminate unnecessary words. The word “employees” is added for clarity and consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.
In subsections (a)(2) and (b)(3), the word “regulations” is substituted for “such rules and regulations as may be necessary” in 49 App.:788 and 789 for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code and because “rules” and “regulations” are synonymous.
In subsection (b)(1), the words “shall carry out this chapter in Guam” are substituted for “In Guam the enforcement and administration of this chapter shall be performed” for consistency in the revised title.
Subsection (c) is added because, under section 502(a)(2) of the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America, as enacted by the Act of March 24, 1976 (Public Law 94–241, 90 Stat. 263), and proclaimed to be in effect by the President on January 9, 1978 (Proc. No. 4534, Oct. 24, 1977, 42 F.R. 56593, 48 U.S.C. 1681 (note)), the Commonwealth was given the same authority as Guam when a law applies to Guam and the States of the United States generally.
In subsection (d), the word “Secretary” is substituted for “by such officers, agents, or other persons as may be authorized or designated for that purpose by the Secretary of the Treasury” because of subsection (a)(1) of this section. The words “or the Governor of Guam or of the Northern Mariana Islands as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section” are added because under 49 App.:789 the Governor of Guam enforces 49 App.:ch. 11 in Guam and because of section 502(a)(2) of the Covenant referred to in the revision note for subsection (c) of this section. The words “the customs laws” are substituted for “That such duties as are imposed upon the collector of customs or any other person with respect to the seizure and forfeiture of vessels and vehicles under the customs laws” because of the restatement and to eliminate unnecessary words.
