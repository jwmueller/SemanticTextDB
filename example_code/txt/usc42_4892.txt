§ 6324. State energy efficiency goals
Each State energy conservation plan with respect to which assistance is made available under this part on or after August 8, 2005, shall contain a goal, consisting of an improvement of 25 percent or more in the efficiency of use of energy in the State concerned in calendar year 2012 as compared to calendar year 1990, and may contain interim goals.
(Pub. L. 94–163, title III, § 364, Dec. 22, 1975, 89 Stat. 935; Pub. L. 95–619, title VI, § 691(b)(2), Nov. 9, 1978, 92 Stat. 3288; Pub. L. 101–440, § 2(a)(1), Oct. 18, 1990, 104 Stat. 1006; Pub. L. 109–58, title I, § 123(b), Aug. 8, 2005, 119 Stat. 616.)

Amendments2005—Pub. L. 109–58 reenacted section catchline without change and amended text generally. Prior to amendment, text read as follows: “Each State energy conservation plan with respect to which assistance is made available under this part on or after October 1, 1991, shall contain a goal, consisting of an improvement of 10 percent or more in the efficiency of use of energy in the State concerned in the calendar year 2000 as compared to the calendar year 1990, and may contain interim goals.”
1990—Pub. L. 101–440 amended section generally. Prior to amendment, section read as follows: “Upon the basis of the reports submitted pursuant to this part and such other information as is available, the Secretary shall, at the earliest practicable date, set an energy conservation goal for each State for 1980 and may set interim goals. Such goal or goals shall consist of the maximum reduction in the consumption of energy during any year as a result of the implementation of the State energy conservation plan described in section 6322(b) of this title which is consistent with technological feasibility, financial resources, and economic objectives, by comparison with the projected energy consumption for such State in such year. The Secretary shall specify the assumptions used in the determination of the projected energy consumption in each State, taking into account population trends, economic growth, and the effects of national energy conservation programs.”
1978—Pub. L. 95–619 substituted “Secretary” for “Administrator”, meaning Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration, wherever appearing.
