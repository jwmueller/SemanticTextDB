The words “Disbursing officials” are substituted for “officers charged with the receipt or disbursement of public moneys” for consistency in the revised title and other titles of the United States Code. The word “mark” is substituted for “write in plain letters” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “counterfeit notes intended to circulate as currency” are substituted for “all fraudulent notes issued in the form of, and intended to circulate as money” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. The last sentence is substituted for the words following the semicolon in 31:424 for clarity and to reflect the legislative history of the derivative source. See 4 Cong. Rec. 2225–2228, 3148. In that sentence, the words “United States currency (including a Federal reserve note or a circulating note of Federal reserve banks and national banks)” are substituted for “any genuine note of the United States, or of the national banks” for consistency with section 5103 of the revised title.
