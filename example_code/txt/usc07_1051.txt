(m) Quality loss adjustment coverage(1) Effect of coverageIf a policy or plan of insurance offered under this subchapter includes quality loss adjustment coverage, the coverage shall provide for a reduction in the quantity of production of the agricultural commodity considered produced during a crop year, or a similar adjustment, as a result of the agricultural commodity not meeting the quality standards established in the policy or plan of insurance.


(2) Additional quality loss adjustment(A) Producer optionNotwithstanding any other provision of law, in addition to the quality loss adjustment coverage available under paragraph (1), the Corporation shall offer producers the option of purchasing quality loss adjustment coverage on a basis that is smaller than a unit with respect to an agricultural commodity that satisfies each of the following:(i) The agricultural commodity is sold on an identity-preserved basis.

(iv) The discount schedules that reflect the reduction in quality of the agricultural commodity are established by the Secretary.


(B) Basis for adjustmentUnder this paragraph, the Corporation shall set the quality standards below which quality losses will be paid based on the variability of the grade of the agricultural commodity from the base quality for the agricultural commodity.



(3) Review of criteria and procedures(A) ReviewThe Corporation shall contract with a qualified person to review the quality loss adjustment procedures of the Corporation so that the procedures more accurately reflect local quality discounts that are applied to agricultural commodities insured under this subchapter.


(B) ProceduresEffective beginning not later than the 2004 reinsurance year, based on the review, the Corporation shall make adjustments in the procedures, taking into consideration the actuarial soundness of the adjustment and the prevention of fraud, waste, and abuse.

(B) ImplementationAs soon as practicable after February 7, 2014, the Corporation shall implement subparagraph (A) on a regional basis based on market conditions and the interests of producers.


(C) Termination of effectivenessThe authority provided by this paragraph terminates effective on the date that is 5 years after the date on which subparagraph (A) is implemented.




(n) Limitation on multiple benefits for same loss(1) In generalExcept as provided in paragraph (2), if a producer who is eligible to receive benefits under catastrophic risk protection under subsection (b) of this section is also eligible to receive assistance for the same loss under any other program administered by the Secretary, the producer shall be required to elect whether to receive benefits under this subchapter or under the other program, but not both. A producer who purchases additional coverage under subsection (c) of this section may also receive assistance for the same loss under other programs administered by the Secretary, except that the amount received for the loss under the additional coverage together with the amount received under the other programs may not exceed the amount of the actual loss of the producer.


(2) ExceptionParagraph (1) shall not apply to emergency loans under subtitle C of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1961 et seq.).



(o) Crop production on native sod(1) Definition of native sodIn this subsection, the term “native sod” means land—(A) on which the plant cover is composed principally of native grasses, grasslike plants, forbs, or shrubs suitable for grazing and browsing; and

(B) that has never been tilled, or the producer cannot substantiate that the ground has ever been tilled, for the production of an annual crop as of the date of enactment of this subsection.


(2) Reduction in benefits(A) In generalDuring the first 4 crop years of planting, as determined by the Secretary, native sod acreage that has been tilled for the production of an annual crop after February 7, 2014, shall be subject to a reduction in benefits under this subchapter as described in this paragraph.

(II) the crop insurance premium subsidy provided for the producer under this subchapter, except for coverage authorized pursuant to subsection (b)(1), shall be 50 percentage points less than the premium subsidy that would otherwise apply.


(ii) Yield substitutionDuring the period native sod acreage is covered by this subsection, a producer may not substitute yields for the native sod.




(3) ApplicationThis subsection shall only apply to native sod acreage in the States of Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Nebraska.
