§ 1433c–1. Advance recourse loans(a) Availability; due date; procedures for repayment; applicability; security; limitationIt is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Agriculture carry out a program authorized by section 424 of the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1433c]. Such program, if implemented, shall provide for the following:(1) Advance recourse loans shall be made available only to those producers of a commodity who are unable to obtain sufficient credit elsewhere to finance the production of the 1986 crop of that commodity, taking into consideration prevailing private and cooperative rates and terms for loans for similar purposes (as determined by the Secretary) in the community in or near which the applicant resides. A producer who has received a commitment or been furnished sufficient credit or a loan for production of the 1986 crop of a commodity shall not be eligible for an advance recourse loan to finance the production of that commodity for such crop year.

(2) Advance recourse loans shall be made available to producers of a commodity at the applicable nonrecourse loan rate for the commodity (as determined by the Secretary). Within the limits set out in paragraphs (5) and (7), advance recourse loans shall be available—(A) to producers of wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice who agree to participate in the program announced for the commodity on an amount of the commodity equal to one-half of the farm program yield for the commodity multiplied by the farm program acreage intended to be planted to the commodity for harvest in 1986, as determined by the Secretary;

(B) to producers of peanuts who are on a farm for which a marketing quota or poundage quota has been established on an amount of the commodity equal to one-half of the farm marketing quota or poundage quota for the commodity, as determined by the Secretary; and

(C) to producers of other commodities on an amount of the commodity equal to one-half of the farm yield for the commodity multiplied by the farm acreage intended to be planted to the commodity for harvest in 1986, as determined by the Secretary.


(3) An advance recourse loan under section 424 [7 U.S.C. 1433c] shall come due at such time immediately following harvest as the Secretary determines appropriate. Each loan contract entered into under section 424 shall specify the date on which the loan is to come due.

(4)(A) The Secretary shall establish procedures, when practicable, under which a producer, simultaneously with repayment of his recourse loan, may obtain a nonrecourse loan on his crop (as otherwise provided for in the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.]) in an amount sufficient to repay his recourse loan.

(B) In cases in which nonrecourse loans under such Act are not normally made available directly to producers, the Secretary shall establish procedures under which a producer may repay a recourse loan at the same time the producer receives advances or other payment from the producer’s disposition of his crop.


(5) Advance recourse loans shall be made available as needed solely to cover costs involved in the production of the 1986 crop that are incurred or are outstanding on or after March 20, 1986.

(6) To obtain an advance recourse loan, the producer on a farm must—(A) provide as security for the loan a first lien on the crop covered by the loan or provide such other security as may be available to the producer and determined by the Secretary to be adequate to protect the Government’s interests; and

(B) obtain multiperil crop insurance, if available, to protect the crop that serves as security for the loan.


If a producer does not have multiperil crop insurance and is located in a county in which the signup period for multiperil crop insurance has expired, the producer shall be required to obtain other crop insurance, if available.

(7) The total amount in advance recourse loans that may be made to a producer under section 424 [7 U.S.C. 1433c] may not exceed $50,000.

(8) An advance recourse loan may be made available only to a producer who agrees to comply with such other terms and conditions determined appropriate by the Secretary and consistent with the provisions of section 424 [7 U.S.C. 1433c].


(b) Use of Commodity Credit Corporation, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, and county committeesThe Secretary shall carry out the program provided for under section 424 [7 U.S.C. 1433c] through the Commodity Credit Corporation, using the services of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service and the county committees established under section 590h(b) of title 16 to make determinations of eligibility with respect to the credit test under subsection (a)(1), and determinations as to the sufficiency of security under subsection (a)(6). The Secretary may use such committees for such other purposes as the Secretary determines appropriate in carrying out section 424.


(c) RegulationsIt is further the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Agriculture issue or, as appropriate, amend regulations to implement any program established under section 424 [7 U.S.C. 1433c] as soon as practicable, but not later than 15 days after March 20, 1986. Loans and other assistance provided under such program shall be made available beginning on the date such regulations are issued or amended.
