§ 6307. Contracts with Federal Government-owned establishments and availability of appropriations
An order or contract placed with a Federal Government-owned establishment for work, material, or the manufacture of material pertaining to an approved project is deemed to be an obligation in the same manner that a similar order or contract placed with a commercial manufacturer or private contractor is an obligation. Appropriations remain available to pay an obligation to a Federal Government-owned establishment just as appropriations remain available to pay an obligation to a commercial manufacturer or private contractor.
(Pub. L. 111–350, § 3, Jan. 4, 2011, 124 Stat. 3806.)
