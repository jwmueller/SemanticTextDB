§ 650. Coast Guard Supply Fund(a) A Coast Guard Supply Fund is authorized. The Secretary may prescribe regulations for designating the classification of materials to be stocked. In these regulations, whenever the fund is extended to include items not previously stocked, or spare parts obtained as part of a procurement under a different account of major items such as vessels or aircraft, whether or not such parts were previously stocked, the Secretary may authorize an increase in the existing capital of the fund by the value of such usable materials transferred thereto from Coast Guard inventories carried in other accounts. Except for the materials so transferred, the fund shall be charged with the cost of materials purchased or otherwise acquired. The fund shall be credited with the value of materials consumed, issued for use, sold, or otherwise disposed of, such values to be determined on a basis that will approximately cover the cost thereof.

(b) Obligations may, without regard to fiscal year limitations, be incurred against anticipated reimbursement to the Coast Guard Supply Fund in such amount and for such period, as the Secretary, with approval of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, may determine to be necessary to maintain stock levels consistently with planned operations for the next year.
