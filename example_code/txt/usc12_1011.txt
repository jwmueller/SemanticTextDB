References in TextTitle II of that Act, referred to in subsec. (b)(3)(A), probably means title II of Pub. L. 111–203, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which is classified principally to subchapter II (§ 5381 et seq.) of chapter 53 of this title. The Financial Stability Act of 2010, which is title I of Pub. L. 111–203, does not contain titles. For complete classification of title II to the Code, see Tables.

Prior ProvisionsSubsecs. (a), (b), [former] (e), and [former] (f) are derived from subsec. (k) of former section 264 of this title. See Codification note set out under section 1811 of this title.

Amendments2010—Subsec. (b)(3). Pub. L. 111–203, § 172(a)(2), which directed substitution of “or nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in section 165(a) of the Financial Stability Act of 2010, whenever the Board of Directors determines that a special examination of any such depository institution is necessary to determine the condition of such depository institution for insurance purposes, or of such nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or bank holding company described in section 165(a) of the Financial Stability Act of 2010, for the purpose of implementing its authority to provide for orderly liquidation of any such company under title II of that Act, provided that such authority may not be used with respect to any such company that is in a generally sound condition.
“(B) Limitation.—Before conducting a special examination of a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in section 165(a) of the Financial Stability Act of 2010, the Corporation shall review any available and acceptable resolution plan that the company has submitted in accordance with section 165(d) of that Act, consistent with the nonbinding effect of such plan, and available reports of examination, and shall coordinate to the maximum extent practicable with the Board of Governors, in order to minimize duplicative or conflicting examinations.”
for “ ‘whenever the board of directors determines’ and all that follows through the period”, was executed by making the substitution for “whenever the Board of Directors determines” and all that followed through the period, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
