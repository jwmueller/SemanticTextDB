“SEC. 3. ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISION.“(a) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Secretary’) shall estimate the rates at which the authority to make commitments to insure mortgages and loans under the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.], and the authority to make commitments to issue guarantees under section 306(g) of that Act [12 U.S.C. 1721(g)], are likely to be used for the remainder of any fiscal year. The Secretary shall make these estimates at such times as the Secretary deems appropriate, but not less frequently than monthly.

“(b) If an estimate under subsection (a) indicates that either limitation on authority to make commitments for a fiscal year referred to in subsection (a) will be reached before the end of that fiscal year, or in any event whenever 75 per centum of either authority to make commitments has been utilized, the Secretary shall promptly so notify the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs [now Committee on Financial Services] of the House of Representatives.”
