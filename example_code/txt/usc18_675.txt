Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 420f, 420g, and 420h (Dec. 24, 1942, ch. 823, §§ 1, 2, 3, 56 Stat. 1087).
This section consolidates the offense, penalty, and definitive provisions of sections 420f, 420g, and 420h of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as subsections (a) and (b).
The definition of “denture” was omitted as unnecessary in view of the phraseology of the revised section, the context of which makes clear the meaning of dentures referred to.
The definition of “Territory” was omitted as unnecessary. The revised section makes clear the places included in the application of the section without the use of definitions.
The definition of “Interstate Commerce” was likewise omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of interstate commerce in section 10 of this title.
Changes of phraseology and arrangement were made, but without change of substance.

Amendments2002—Pub. L. 107–273 struck out “, the Canal Zone” after “the District of Columbia” in first par.
1996—Pub. L. 104–294 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $1,000” in last par.
