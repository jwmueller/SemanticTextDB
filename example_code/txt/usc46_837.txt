In this section, the tax rates for fiscal years 1991 through 2002 are omitted as obsolete.
In subsection (a)(1), the words “West Indies Islands” are substituted for “West India Islands” to conform to current geographic terminology. The word “Newfoundland” is omitted because Newfoundland is now part of Canada.
In subsection (a)(2), the reference to the definitions in section 2101 is confined to “recreational vessel” because the definitions of “vessel of the United States” and “barge” are being moved to chapter 1 of the revised title and being made applicable title-wide.
