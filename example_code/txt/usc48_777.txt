“Section 254“(a) In determining any income tax imposed by the Government of the Marshall Islands or the Federated States of Micronesia, those Governments shall have authority to impose tax upon income derived by a resident of the Marshall Islands or the Federated States of Micronesia from sources without the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia, in the same manner and to the same extent as those Governments impose tax upon income derived from within their respective jurisdictions. If the Government of the Marshall Islands or the Federated States of Micronesia exercises such authority as provided in this subsection, any individual resident of the Marshall Islands or the Federated States of Micronesia who is subject to tax by the Government of the United States on income which is also taxed by the Government of the Marshall Islands or the Federated States of Micronesia shall be relieved of liability to the Government of the United States for the tax which, but for this subsection, would otherwise be imposed by the Government of the United States on such income. For purposes of this Section, the term ‘resident of the Marshall Islands or the Federated States of Micronesia’ shall be deemed to include any person who was physically present in the Marshall Islands or the Federated States of Micronesia for a period of 183 or more days during any taxable year; provided, that as between the Government of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia, the authority to tax an individual resident of the Marshall Islands or the Federated States of Micronesia in respect of income from sources without the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia as provided in this subsection may be exercised only by the Government in whose jurisdiction such individual was physically present for the greatest number of days during the taxable year.

“(b) If the Government of the Marshall Islands or the Federated States of Micronesia subjects income to taxation substantially similar to that imposed by the Trust Territory Code in effect on January 1, 1980, such Government shall be deemed to have exercised the authority described in Section 254(a).
