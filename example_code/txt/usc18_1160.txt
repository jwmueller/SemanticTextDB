§ 3488. Intoxicating liquor in Indian country as evidence of unlawful introduction
The possession by a person of intoxicating liquors in Indian country where the introduction is prohibited by treaty or Federal statute shall be prima facie evidence of unlawful introduction.
(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 834.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 245 of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians (May 18, 1916, ch. 125, § 1, 39 Stat. 124).
The only change made was the insertion of the word “Indian” before “country”, to substitute specificity for generality. (See definition of “Indian country” in section 1151 of this title.)
