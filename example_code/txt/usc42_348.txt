Findings and PurposesPub. L. 99–649, § 2, Nov. 10, 1986, 100 Stat. 3633, provided that:
“(a) The Congress finds and declares that:“(1) Injury is one of the principal public health problems in America, and causes over 140,000 deaths per year.

“(2) Injury rates are particularly high for children and the elderly.

“(3) Injury causes 50 percent of all deaths for children over the age of one year and two-thirds of all deaths for children over the age of 15 years, and is the leading cause of death for individuals under the age of 44 years. Individuals over the age of 65 years have the highest fatality rates for many injuries.

“(4) Injury control has not been given high priority in the United States, and the research being conducted on injury control and the number of personnel involved in injury control activities are not adequate.


“(b) The purposes of this Act [enacting this part] are—“(1) to promote research into the causes, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and control of injuries and rehabilitation from injuries;

“(2) to promote cooperation between specialists in fields involved in injury research; and

“(3) to promote coordination between Federal, State, and local governments and public and private entities in order to achieve a reduction in deaths from injuries.”
