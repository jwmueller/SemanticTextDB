(3) the relevant approved State plans.


(b) Elements of review systemThe regulations referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall—(1) specify the timetable for conformity reviews of State programs, including—(A) an initial review of each State program;

(B) a timely review of a State program following a review in which such program was found not to be in substantial conformity; and

(2) specify the requirements subject to review (which shall include determining whether the State program is in conformity with the requirement of section 671(a)(27) of this title), and the criteria to be used to measure conformity with such requirements and to determine whether there is a substantial failure to so conform;

(3) specify the method to be used to determine the amount of any Federal matching funds to be withheld (subject to paragraph (4)) due to the State program’s failure to so conform, which ensures that—(A) such funds will not be withheld with respect to a program, unless it is determined that the program fails substantially to so conform;

(B) such funds will not be withheld for a failure to so conform resulting from the State’s reliance upon and correct use of formal written statements of Federal law or policy provided to the State by the Secretary; and

(C) the amount of such funds withheld is related to the extent of the failure to so conform; and


(4) require the Secretary, with respect to any State program found to have failed substantially to so conform—(A) to afford the State an opportunity to adopt and implement a corrective action plan, approved by the Secretary, designed to end the failure to so conform;

(B) the amount of the Federal matching funds (if any) to be withheld from the State;


(2) afford the State an opportunity to appeal the determination to the Departmental Appeals Board within 60 days after receipt of the notice described in paragraph (1) (or, if later, after failure to continue or to complete a corrective action plan); and

(3) afford the State an opportunity to obtain judicial review of an adverse decision of the Board, within 60 days after the State receives notice of the decision of the Board, by appeal to the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the principal or headquarters office of the agency responsible for administering the program is located.
