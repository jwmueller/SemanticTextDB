“In the case of any plan maintained on January 1, 1974, if, not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act [Sept. 2, 1974], the plan administrator petitions the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Labor may prescribe an alternate method which shall be treated as satisfying the requirements of subsection (a)(2) of section 411 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [formerly I.R.C. 1954], or of subsection (b)(1) (other than subparagraph (D) thereof) of such section 411, or of both such provisions for a period of not more than 4 years. The Secretary may prescribe such alternate method only when he finds that—“(1) the application of such requirements would increase the costs of the plan to such an extent that there would result a substantial risk to the voluntary continuation of the plan or a substantial curtailment of benefit levels or the levels of employees’ compensation,

“(2) the application of such requirements or discontinuance of the plan would be adverse to the interests of plan participants in the aggregate, and

“(3) a waiver or extension of time granted under [former] section 412(d) or (e) would be inadequate.


In the case of any plan with respect to which an alternate method has been prescribed under the preceding provisions of this subsection for a period of not more than 4 years, if, not later than 1 year before the expiration of such period, the plan administrator petitions the Secretary of Labor for an extension of such alternate method, and the Secretary makes the findings required by the preceding sentence, such alternate method may be extended for not more than 3 years.”
