In subsection (a), the words “law of a State” are substituted for “any State statute” for consistency in the revised title. The words “regulating the right to recover for death” are substituted for “giving or regulating rights of action or remedies for death” to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsection (b), the words “or to any navigable waters in the Panama Canal Zone” are omitted because the Panama Canal Zone was transferred to the Republic of Panama.
