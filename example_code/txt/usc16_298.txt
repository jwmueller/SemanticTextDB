Codification
As enacted by act June 29, 1906, this section began with a clause naming the park which was stricken out and inserted as the last sentence of section 111 of this title.
A provision for the making of necessary rules and regulations by the Secretary of the Interior has been omitted by reason of the reference to section 3 of this title, derived from act Aug. 25, 1916, ch. 408, § 3, 39 Stat. 535, authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to make and publish rules and regulations applicable to National Parks.
