The Secretary may order the adjustment in the division of the joint price to be made retroactively to the date the complaint was filed, the date the order for an investigation was made, or a later date the Secretary decides is reasonable.

In subsection (a), the words “interstate air transportation of persons, air transportation of property within the State of Alaska, air transportation of property within the state of Hawaii, or overseas or” are omitted because 49:1551(a)(5)(D) provides that 49 App.:1482(h) applies only to foreign air transportation. The words “unreasonable or unreasonably discriminatory” are substituted for “unjust, unreasonable, inequitable, or unduly preferential or prejudicial” for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words. See the revision notes following 49:10101. The words “against any of those carriers” are substituted for “as between the air carriers or foreign air carriers parties thereto” to eliminate unnecessary words. The word “retroactively” is added for clarity.
In subsection (b), the words “an opportunity for a” are added for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.
