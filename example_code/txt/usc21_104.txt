(2) A civil penalty under paragraph (1) shall be assessed by the Secretary by an order made on the record after providing written notice to the person to be assessed a civil penalty and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with this paragraph and section 554 of title 5.

(B) The Secretary may retract or modify any prior comments the Secretary has provided to an advertisement submitted to the Secretary based on new information or changed circumstances, so long as the Secretary provides written notice to the person of the new views of the Secretary on the advertisement and provides a reasonable time for modification or correction of the advertisement prior to seeking any civil penalty under paragraph (1).


(5) The Secretary may compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, any civil penalty which may be assessed under paragraph (1). The amount of such penalty, when finally determined, or the amount charged upon in compromise, may be deducted from any sums owed by the United States to the person charged.

the Attorney General of the United States shall recover the amount assessed (plus interest at currently prevailing rates from the date of the expiration of the 60-day period referred to in paragraph (6) or the date of such final judgment, as the case may be) in an action brought in any appropriate district court of the United States. In such an action, the validity, amount, and appropriateness of such penalty shall not be subject to review.

References in TextThe Controlled Substances Act, referred to in subsec. (e)(3), is title II of Pub. L. 91–513, Oct. 27, 1970, 84 Stat. 1242, which is classified principally to subchapter I (§ 801 et seq.) of chapter 13 of this title.

Section 282(j)(5)(C)(ii) of title 42, referred to in subsec. (f)(3)(B), was in the original “section 402(j)(5)(C)(ii)”, and was translated as meaning section 402(j)(5)(C)(ii) of the Public Health Service Act to reflect the probable intent of Congress because there is no subsec. (j) of section 402 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and section 402(j)(5)(C)(ii) of the Public Health Service Act relates to notification of noncompliance with clinical trial information requirements.
Section 353c of this title, referred to in subsec. (g)(3)(B), was in the original a reference to section 503B of act June 25, 1938, and was translated as if it referred to section 503C of that Act, to reflect the probable intent of Congress and the renumbering of section 503B as 503C by Pub. L. 113–54, title I, § 102(a)(1), Nov. 27, 2013, 127 Stat. 587, and its transfer to section 353c of this title. A new section 503B, which was enacted by section 102(a)(2) of Pub.
