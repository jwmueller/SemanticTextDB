DerivationU.S. CodeRevised Statutes andStatutes at Large


 5 U.S.C. 633(4).Jan. 16, 1883, ch. 27, § 2(4), 22 Stat. 404.


The authority of the President to prescribe rules is carried into sections 2951, 3302, 3304(a), 3306(a), 3321, 7152, 7153, 7321, and 7322 of this title.
In paragraph (2), the words “in respect to the execution of this act” are changed to “concerning the execution of the provisions of this title that relate to the administration of the competitive service” to avoid having to refer in the text to the sections of this title into which the Civil Service Act, the act referred to, is codified. These sections are: 1101, 1102, 1105, 1302(a), 1303, 1307, 1308(a)(1), 2102, 2951, 3302, 3303, 3304(a), (d), 3305(a), 3306, 3318(a), 3319(a), 3321, 7152, 7153, 7321, 7322, and 7352. The words “the provisions of this title that relate to the administration of the competitive service” will include some of the sections derived from the Veterans’ Preference Act of 1944 (former sections 851–869). They are based in part on former section 860 (codified in § 1302(c)). The authorization in that section to make and enforce regulations for the competitive service would include the authority to investigate and report. The words “and other employees” are substituted for “and its own subordinates, and those in the public service” in view of the definition of “employee” in section 2105.
Standard changes are made to conform with the definition applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.

Amendments1978—Pub. L. 95–454 substituted in opening par. “Office of Personnel Management, Merit Systems Protection Board, and Special Counsel” for “Civil Service Commission” and in par. (1) “Office of Personnel Management” for “Commission”.

Effective Date of 1978 AmendmentAmendment by Pub. L. 95–454 effective 90 days after Oct. 13, 1978, see section 907 of Pub. L. 95–454, set out as a note under section 1101 of this title.
