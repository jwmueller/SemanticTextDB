In clause (2) the words “in his custody” are inserted to make clear the fact that the marshal has custody of the prize property.
In clause (5) the words “and be responsible for” are inserted for clarity, since 34 U.S.C. 1144 provides that the sale and deposit of the proceeds shall be made by the auctioneer and his agent rather than by the marshal, although the marshal supervises them. The words “Treasurer of the United States or public de­positary” are substituted for “assistant treasurer” to reflect the Act of May 29, 1920, ch. 214, 41 Stat. 654.
