In subsection (a) the word “annually” and the words “and regularly commission” are omitted as surplusage. The word “male” is inserted in subsection (a) to limit the application of the appointing authority in this subsection to men. Authority to appoint women is covered in § 5590 of this title.
In subsection (b) the words “on the active list” are inserted in order to exclude reserve and temporary officers, which is the intention of Congress determined from the use of the words “additional numbers in grade” and “percentage of officers on the active list” which apply only to regular officers holding permanent appointments. In the same subsection and in subsections (c) and (d) the provisions of the law that these officers are assigned to a certain duty and then “described and known as officers designated” for that duty have been written simply as providing that these officers may be “designated” for that duty. This is done as there is no apparent reason for any distinction between these officers and those appointed under subsection (a). In subsection (c) the words “specialized duties in the fields of” are omitted as surplusage.
