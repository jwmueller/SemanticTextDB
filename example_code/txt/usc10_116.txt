In subsection (a), the words “consistent with other provisions of sections 171–171n, 172–172j, 181–1, 181–2, 411a, 411b, and 626–626d of this title and sections 401–405 of Title 50” are omitted as surplusage.

L. 104–106 substituted “Other members and part-time advisers shall (except as otherwise specifically authorized by law) serve without compensation for such service.” for “Other members and part-time advisers may serve without compensation or may be paid not more than $50 for each day of service, as the Secretary determines.”
