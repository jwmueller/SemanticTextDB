§ 773j. Authorization of appropriations
There is hereby authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year 1983 and beyond, such sums as may be necessary for carrying out the Convention and this subchapter, including—(a) necessary travel expenses of the United States Commissioners or alternate Commissioners; and

(b) the United States share of the joint expenses of the Commission: Provided, That the Commissioners shall not, with respect to commitments concerning the United States share of the joint expenses of the Commission, be subject to section 262(b) 11 So in original. Probably should be section “262b”. of title 22 insofar as it limits the authority of United States representatives to international organizations with respect to such commitments.
