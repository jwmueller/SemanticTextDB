Historical and Revision Notes
1948 ActBased on sections 1026(b) and 1514(c) of title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Agriculture, and sections 264(u), 984, 1121, 1138d(c), 1311, 1441(c), 1467(c), and 1731(c) of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, and section 616(c) of title 15, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Commerce and Trade (Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, § 12B(u), as added June 16, 1933, ch. 89, § 8, 48 Stat. 178; July 17, 1916, ch. 245, § 31, fourth paragraph, 39 Stat. 382; July 17, 1916, ch. 245, § 211(a), as added Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, § 2, 42 Stat. 1459; Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, title II, § 216(a), 42 Stat. 1471; Jan. 22, 1932, ch. 8, § 16(c), 47 Stat. 11; July 22, 1932, ch. 522, § 21(c), 47 Stat. 738; Mar. 27, 1933, Ex. Ord. No. 6084; June 13, 1933, ch. 64, § 8(c), 48 Stat. 135; June 16, 1933, ch. 98, § 64(c), 48 Stat. 268; Jan. 31, 1934, ch. 7, § 13, 48 Stat. 347; June 27, 1934, ch. 847, § 512(c), 48 Stat. 1265; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, § 101, 49 Stat. 701; July 22, 1937, ch. 517, title IV, § 52(b), 50 Stat. 532; Feb. 16, 1938, ch. 30, title V, § 514(c), 52 Stat. 76; Aug. 14, 1946, ch. 964, § 3, 60 Stat. 1064).
Each of the eleven sections from which this section was derived contained similar provisions relating to embezzlement, false entries, and fraudulent issuance or assignment of obligations with respect to one or more named agencies or corporations.
These were separated and the embezzlement and misapplication provisions of all form the basis of this section, and with one exception the remaining provisions of each section forming the basis for section 1006 of this title. The sole exception was that portion of said section 616(c) of title 15 as to the disclosure of information which now forms section 1904 of this title.
The revised section condenses and simplifies the constituent provisions without change of substance except as in this note indicated.
The punishment in each section was the same except that in section 1026(b) of title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Agriculture, and sections 984, 1121, and 1311 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, the maximum fine was $5,000. The revised section adopts the $5,000 maximum. (For same penalty covering similar offense, see section 656 of this title.)
The smaller punishment for an offense involving $100 or less was added. (See reviser’s notes to sections 641–645 of this title.)
The enumeration of “moneys, funds, credits, securities, or other things of value” does not occur in any one of the original sections but is an adequate, composite enumeration of the instruments mentioned in each.
References to persons aiding and abetting contained in sections 984, 1121, 1311 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, were omitted as unnecessary, such persons being made principals by section 2 of this title.
The term “receiver” is used in sections 1121 and 1311 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, with reference to Federal intermediate banks and agricultural credit corporations, and is undoubtedly embraced in the term “connected in any capacity with,” but the phrase “and whoever, being a receiver of any such institution” was inserted in this section to obviate all doubt as to its comprehensive scope.
The suggestion has been made that “private examiners” should be included. These undoubtedly are covered by the words “connected in any capacity with.” (See also section 655 of this title.)
The term “or any department or agency of the United States” was inserted in each revised section in order to clarify the sweeping provisions against fraudulent acts and to obviate any possibility of ambiguity by reason of the omission of specific agencies named in the constituent sections. (See section 6 of this title defining “department and agency.” For other verbal changes and deletions see reviser’s note under section 656 of this title.)

Senate Revision AmendmentCertain words were stricken from the section as being unnecessary and inconsistent with other sections of this revision defining embezzlement and without changing existing law. See Senate Report No. 1620, amendment No. 7, 80th Cong.

1949 Act[Section 11] conforms section 657 of title 18, U.S.C., to administrative practice which in turn was modified to comply with congressional policy “not to use the Farmers Home Corporation to carry out the functions and duties provided for in H.R. 5991 [Farmers Home Administration Act of 1946] but to vest the authority in the Secretary of Agriculture to be administered through the Farmers Home Administration as an agency of the Department of Agriculture” (H. Rept. No. 2683, to accompany H.R. 5991, 79th Cong., 2d sess.).
