“In any case where—“(1) an individual performed service, as an employee of an organization which is deemed under section 3121(k)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [formerly I.R.C. 1954] to have filed a waiver certificate under section 3121(k)(1) of such Code, at any time prior to the period for which such certificate is effective;

“(2) the taxes imposed by sections 3101 and 3111 of such Code were paid with respect to remuneration paid for such service, but such service (or any part thereof) does not constitute employment (as defined in section 210(a) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 410(a)] and section 3121(b) of such Code because the applicable taxes so paid were refunded or credited (otherwise than through a refund or credit which would have been allowed if a valid waiver certificate filed under section 3121(k)(1) of such Code had been in effect) prior to September 9, 1976; and

“(3) any portion of such service (with respect to which taxes were paid and refunded or credited as described in paragraph (2)) would constitute employment (as so defined) if the organization had actually filed under section 3121(k)(1) of such Code a valid waiver certificate effective as provided in section 3121(k)(5)(B) thereof (with such individual’s signature appearing on the accompanying list),


the remuneration paid for the portion of such service described in paragraph (3) shall, upon the request of such individual (filed on or before April 15, 1980, in such manner and form, and with such official, as may be prescribed by regulations made under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.]) accompanied by full repayment of the taxes which were paid under section 3101 of such Code with respect to such remuneration and so refunded or credited (or by satisfactory evidence that appropriate arrangements have been made for the repayment of such taxes in installments as provided in section 3121(k)(8) of such Code), be deemed to constitute remuneration for employment as so defined. In any case where remuneration paid by an organization to an individual is deemed under the preceding sentence to constitute remuneration for employment, such organization shall be liable (notwithstanding any other provision of such Code) for repayment of any taxes which it paid under section 3111 of such Code with respect to such remuneration and which were refunded or credited to it.”
