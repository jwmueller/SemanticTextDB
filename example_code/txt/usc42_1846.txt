(2) the limitations on payment (including deductibles and coinsurance amounts) that are imposed under this subchapter, and

(3) a description of the limited benefits for long-term care services available under this subchapter and generally available under State plans approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter.


Such notice shall be mailed annually to individuals entitled to benefits under part A or part B of this subchapter and when an individual applies for benefits under part A of this subchapter or enrolls under part B of this subchapter.

(b) Medicare and medigap informationThe Secretary shall provide information via a toll-free telephone number on the programs under this subchapter. The Secretary shall provide, through the toll-free telephone number 1–800–MEDICARE, for a means by which individuals seeking information about, or assistance with, such programs who phone such toll-free number are transferred (without charge) to appropriate entities for the provision of such information or assistance. Such toll-free number shall be the toll-free number listed for general information and assistance in the annual notice under subsection (a) of this section instead of the listing of numbers of individual contractors.


(c) Contents of noticeThe notice provided under subsection (a) of this section shall include—(1) a statement which indicates that because errors do occur and because medicare fraud, waste, and abuse is a significant problem, beneficiaries should carefully check any explanation of benefits or itemized statement furnished pursuant to section 1395b–7 of this title for accuracy and report any errors or questionable charges by calling the toll-free phone number described in paragraph (4);

(2) a statement of the beneficiary’s right to request an itemized statement for medicare items and services (as provided in section 1395b–7(b) of this title);
