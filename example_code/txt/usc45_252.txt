Amendments1980—Par. (5). Pub. L. 96–448 inserted “, the estate of such Company in its reorganization proceeding, or the trustee appointed in such proceeding” after “Railroad Company”. The amendment was executed by inserting amendatory text preceding the semicolon instead of the period at end of par. (5) as directed to reflect the probable intent of Congress, in view of par. (5) being enacted without a closing period.
