The words “and on such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe” and 49 App.:1602(a)(1)(D) (3d sentence) are omitted as unnecessary because of section 5334(a) of the revised title and 49:322(a).

The words “net project cost” are substituted for “what portion of the cost of a project to be assisted under section 1602 of this Appendix cannot be reasonably financed from revenues—which portion shall hereinafter be called ‘net project cost’ ” because of the definition of “net project cost” in section 5302(a) of the revised title.
