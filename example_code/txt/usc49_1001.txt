In this chapter, the word “places” is substituted for “points” for consistency in the revised title. The words “United States Postal Service” and “Postal Service” are substituted for “Postmaster General” in sections 401, 405, and 406 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Public Law 85–726, 72 Stat. 754, 760) because of sections 4(a) and 6(o) of the Postal Reorganization Act (Public Law 91–375, 84 Stat. 773, 783).
In subsection (a), the words “Except as provided in section 41906 of this title and section 5402 of title 39” are added because section 41906 of the revised title and 39:5402 contain exceptions to the provisions restated in this subsection. The words “transport mail by aircraft in foreign air transportation or between places in Alaska” are substituted for “transport mail” because 49 App.:1551(a)(4)(A) provides that 49 App.:1375(b) no longer applies to interstate or overseas air transportation (except transportation of mail between 2 places in Alaska).
In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words “from time to time” are omitted as surplus. Clauses (1) and (2) are substituted for “to engage in air transportation” because 49 App.:1551(a)(4)(A) provides that 49 App.:1375(b) no longer applies to interstate or overseas air transportation (except transportation of mail between 2 places in Alaska). In clause (4), the words “between places described in clauses (1) and (2) of this subsection and every change in each schedule” are substituted for “between such points” for clarity.
In subsection (c)(1), the words “any schedule of an air carrier filed under subsection (b)(3) of this section” are substituted for “any such schedule” for clarity.
In subsection (c)(2), the words “by order” are omitted as surplus.
In subsection (d), the word “alter” is omitted as being included in “amend, or modify”.
In subsection (e), the words “adversely affected” are substituted for “aggrieved” for consistency in the revised title. The words “appeal the order” are substituted for “apply . . . for a review of such order” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words “The Board may review, and” are omitted as surplus. The words “amend, modify” are substituted for “amend, revise” for consistency in the revised title.
Subsection (f) is substituted for 49 App.:1375(b) (8th sentence) to reflect the transfer of functions of the Civil Aeronautics Board to the Secretary of Transportation.
