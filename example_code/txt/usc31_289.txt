(2) The Administrator of General Services may exempt bills, a particular mode or modes of transportation, or an agency or subagency from a prepayment audit and verification and in lieu thereof require a postpayment audit, based on cost effectiveness, public interest, or other factors the Administrator considers appropriate.

(3) Expenses for prepayment audits shall be funded by the agency’s appropriations used for the transportation services.

(4) The audit authority provided to agencies by this section is subject to oversight by the Administrator.


(b) The Administrator may conduct pre- or post-payment audits of transportation bills of any Federal agency. The number and types of bills audited shall be based on the Administrator’s judgment.

(c)(1) The Administrator shall adjudicate transportation claims which cannot be resolved by the agency procuring the transportation services, or the carrier or freight-forwarder presenting the bill.

(2) A claim under this section shall be allowed only if it is received by the Administrator not later than 3 years (excluding time of war) after the later of the following dates:(A) The date of accrual of the claim.

(B) The date payment for the transportation is made.

(C) The date a refund for an overpayment for the transportation is made.

(D) The date a deduction under subsection (d) of this section is made.



(d) Not later than 3 years (excluding time of war) after the time a bill is paid, the Government may deduct from an amount subsequently due a carrier or freight forwarder an amount paid on the bill that was greater than the rate allowed under—(1) a lawful tariff under title 49 or on file with the Secretary of Transportation with respect to foreign air transportation (as defined in section 40102(a) of title 49), the Federal Maritime Commission, or a State transportation authority;

(2) a lawfully quoted rate subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board; or

Payment to any contractor for audit services shall not exceed 50 percent of the overpayment identified by contract audit.
