“SEC. 311. CASES PENDING UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY ACT.“At the end of one calendar year following the date the amendments made by subtitle A of title II of this Act [§§ 201 to 231 of Pub. L. 99–554, see Tables for classification] take effect in a district in which any case is still pending under the Bankruptcy Act [see 11 U.S.C. notes prec. 101], the district court shall withdraw the reference of any such case and, after notice and a hearing, determine the status of the case. Such case shall be remanded to the bankruptcy judge with such instructions as are necessary for the prompt closing of the case and with a requirement that a progress report on the case be provided by the bankruptcy judge after such interval as the district court deems appropriate.”
