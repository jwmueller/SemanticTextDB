(2)(A) The Secretary shall then pay to the State, in such installments as he may determine, the amount so estimated, reduced or increased to the extent of any overpayment or underpayment which the Secretary determines was made under this section to such State for any prior quarter and with respect to which adjustment has not already been made under this subsection.

(B) Expenditures for which payments were made to the State under subsection (a) of this section shall be treated as an overpayment to the extent that the State or local agency administering such plan has been reimbursed for such expenditures by a third party pursuant to the provisions of its plan in compliance with section 1396a(a)(25) of this title.

(C) For purposes of this subsection, when an overpayment is discovered, which was made by a State to a person or other entity, the State shall have a period of 1 year in which to recover or attempt to recover such overpayment before adjustment is made in the Federal payment to such State on account of such overpayment. Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (D), the adjustment in the Federal payment shall be made at the end of the 1-year period, whether or not recovery was made.

(D)(i) In any case where the State is unable to recover a debt which represents an overpayment (or any portion thereof) made to a person or other entity on account of such debt having been discharged in bankruptcy or otherwise being uncollectable, no adjustment shall be made in the Federal payment to such State on account of such overpayment (or portion thereof).

(ii) In any case where the State is unable to recover a debt which represents an overpayment (or any portion thereof) made to a person or other entity due to fraud within 1 year of discovery because there is not a final determination of the amount of the overpayment under an administrative or judicial process (as applicable), including as a result of a judgment being under appeal, no adjustment shall be made in the Federal payment to such State on account of such overpayment (or portion thereof) before the date that is 30 days after the date on which a final judgment (including, if applicable, a final determination on an appeal) is made.



(3)(A) The pro rata share to which the United States is equitably entitled, as determined by the Secretary, of the net amount recovered during any quarter by the State or any political subdivision thereof with respect to medical assistance furnished under the State plan shall be considered an overpayment to be adjusted under this subsection.

(B)(i) Subparagraph (A) and paragraph (2)(B) shall not apply to any amount recovered or paid to a State as part of the comprehensive settlement of November 1998 between manufacturers of tobacco products, as defined in section 5702(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and State Attorneys General, or as part of any individual State settlement or judgment reached in litigation initiated or pursued by a State against one or more such manufacturers.

(4) Upon the making of any estimate by the Secretary under this subsection, any appropriations available for payments under this section shall be deemed obligated.

(5) In any case in which the Secretary estimates that there has been an overpayment under this section to a State on the basis of a claim by such State that has been disallowed by the Secretary under section 1316(d) of this title, and such State disputes such disallowance, the amount of the Federal payment in controversy shall, at the option of the State, be retained by such State or recovered by the Secretary pending a final determination with respect to such payment amount. If such final determination is to the effect that any amount was properly disallowed, and the State chose to retain payment of the amount in controversy, the Secretary shall offset, from any subsequent payments made to such State under this subchapter, an amount equal to the proper amount of the disallowance plus interest on such amount disallowed for the period beginning on the date such amount was disallowed and ending on the date of such final determination at a rate (determined by the Secretary) based on the average of the bond equivalent of the weekly 90-day treasury bill auction rates during such period.

(6)(A) Each State (as defined in subsection (w)(7)(D) of this section) shall include, in the first report submitted under paragraph (1) after the end of each fiscal year, information related to—(i) provider-related donations made to the State or units of local government during such fiscal year, and

(ii) health care related taxes collected by the State or such units during such fiscal year.

(B)(i) Except as provided in clause (ii) of this subparagraph, the applicable income limitation with respect to any family is the amount determined, in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary, to be equivalent to 133⅓ percent of the highest amount which would ordinarily be paid to a family of the same size without any income or resources, in the form of money payments, under the plan of the State approved under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter.

(ii) If the Secretary finds that the operation of a uniform maximum limits payments to families of more than one size, he may adjust the amount otherwise determined under clause (i) to take account of families of different sizes.


(C) The total amount of any applicable income limitation determined under subparagraph (B) shall, if it is not a multiple of $100 or such other amount as the Secretary may prescribe, be rounded to the next higher multiple of $100 or such other amount, as the case may be.


(2)(A) In computing a family’s income for purposes of paragraph (1), there shall be excluded any costs (whether in the form of insurance premiums or otherwise and regardless of whether such costs are reimbursed under another public program of the State or political subdivision thereof) incurred by such family for medical care or for any other type of remedial care recognized under State law or, (B) notwithstanding section 1396o of this title at State option, an amount paid by such family, at the family’s option, to the State, provided that the amount, when combined with costs incurred in prior months, is sufficient when excluded from the family’s income to reduce such family’s income below the applicable income limitation described in paragraph (1). The amount of State expenditures for which medical assistance is available under subsection (a)(1) of this section will be reduced by amounts paid to the State pursuant to this subparagraph.


(3) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), in the case of a family consisting of only one individual, the “highest amount which would ordinarily be paid” to such family under the State’s plan approved under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter shall be the amount determined by the State agency (on the basis of reasonable relationship to the amounts payable under such plan to families consisting of two or more persons) to be the amount of the aid which would ordinarily be payable under such plan to a family (without any income or resources) consisting of one person if such plan provided for aid to such a family.

(4) The limitations on payment imposed by the preceding provisions of this subsection shall not apply with respect to any amount expended by a State as medical assistance for any individual described in section 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(III), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(V), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VI), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VII), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(IX), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(X), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XIII), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XIV), or 55 So in original.

(2) The Secretary shall, as part of his validation procedures under this subsection, conduct timely sample onsite surveys of private and public institutions in which recipients of medical assistance may receive care and services under a State plan approved under this subchapter, and his findings with respect to such surveys (as well as the showings of the State agency required under this subsection) shall be made available for public inspection.

(3)(A) No reduction in the Federal medical assistance percentage of a State otherwise required to be imposed under this subsection shall take effect—(i) if such reduction is due to the State’s unsatisfactory or invalid showing made with respect to a calendar quarter beginning before January 1, 1977;

(ii) before January 1, 1978;

(iii) unless a notice of such reduction has been provided to the State at least 30 days before the date such reduction takes effect; or

(iv) due to the State’s unsatisfactory or invalid showing made with respect to a calendar quarter beginning after September 30, 1977, unless notice of such reduction has been provided to the State no later than the first day of the fourth calendar quarter following the calendar quarter with respect to which such showing was made.


(B) The Secretary shall waive application of any reduction in the Federal medical assistance percentage of a State otherwise required to be imposed under paragraph (1) because a showing by the State, made under such paragraph with respect to a calendar quarter ending after January 1, 1977, and before January 1, 1978, is determined to be either unsatisfactory under such paragraph or invalid under paragraph (2), if the Secretary determines that the State’s showing made under paragraph (1) with respect to any calendar quarter ending on or before December 31, 1978, is satisfactory under such paragraph and is valid under paragraph (2).


(4)(A) The Secretary may not find the showing of a State, with respect to a calendar quarter under paragraph (1), to be satisfactory if the showing is submitted to the Secretary later than the 30th day after the last day of the calendar quarter, unless the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary good cause for not meeting such deadline.

(B) The Secretary shall find a showing of a State, with respect to a calendar quarter under paragraph (1), to be satisfactory under such paragraph with respect to the requirement that the State conduct annual onsite inspections in mental hospitals and intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded under paragraphs (26) and (31) of section 1396a(a) of this title, if the showing demonstrates that the State has conducted such an onsite inspection during the 12-month period ending on the last date of the calendar quarter—(i) in each of not less than 98 per centum of the number of such hospitals and facilities requiring such inspection, and

(ii) in every such hospital or facility which has 200 or more beds,


and that, with respect to such hospitals and facilities not inspected within such period, the State has exercised good faith and due diligence in attempting to conduct such inspection, or if the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it would have made such a showing but for failings of a technical nature only.


(5) In the case of a State’s unsatisfactory or invalid showing made with respect to a type of facility or institutional services in a calendar quarter, the per centum amount of the reduction of the State’s Federal medical assistance percentage for that type of services under paragraph (1) is equal to 33⅓ per centum multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is equal to the total number of patients receiving that type of services in that quarter under the State plan in facilities or institutions for which a showing was required to be made under this subsection, and the numerator of which is equal to the number of such patients receiving such type of services in that quarter in those facilities or institutions for which a satisfactory and valid showing was not made for that calendar quarter.

(6)(A) Recertifications required under section 1396a(a)(44) of this title shall be conducted at least every 60 days in the case of inpatient hospital services.

(iii) 12 months after the date of the initial certification,

(iv) 18 months after the date of the initial certification,

(v) 24 months after the date of the initial certification, and

(vi) every 12 months thereafter.


(C) For purposes of determining compliance with the schedule established by this paragraph, a recertification shall be considered to have been done on a timely basis if it was performed not later than 10 days after the date the recertification was otherwise required and the State establishes good cause why the physician or other person making such recertification did not meet such schedule.

In computing inpatient-bed-days under the previous sentence, the Secretary shall take into account inpatient-bed-days attributable to inpatient-bed-days that are paid for individuals enrolled in a Medicaid managed care plan (under subsection (m) or section 1396u–2 of this title).

(D) In no case may the payments described in paragraph (1)(B) with respect to a Medicaid provider described in paragraph (2)(B) be paid—(i) for any year beginning after 2016 unless the provider has been provided payment under paragraph (1)(B) for the previous year; and

(ii) Amounts described in clause (i) may also be paid to an entity promoting the adoption of certified EHR technology, as designated by the State, if participation in such a payment arrangement is voluntary for the eligible professional involved and if such entity does not retain more than 5 percent of such payments for costs not related to certified EHR technology (and support services including maintenance and training) that is for, or is necessary for the operation of, such technology.


(B) A Medicaid provider described in paragraph (2)(A) is responsible for payment of the remaining 15 percent of the net average allowable cost and shall be determined to have met such responsibility to the extent that the payment to the Medicaid provider is not in excess of 85 percent of the net average allowable cost.

(C)(i) Subject to clause (ii), with respect to payments to a Medicaid provider—(I) for the first year of payment to the Medicaid provider under this subsection, the Medicaid provider demonstrates that it is engaged in efforts to adopt, implement, or upgrade certified EHR technology; and

Such coordination shall include, to the extent practicable, a data matching process between State Medicaid agencies and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services using national provider identifiers. For such purposes, the Secretary may require the submission of such data relating to payments to such Medicaid providers as the Secretary may specify.

(8) In carrying out paragraph (6)(C), the State and Secretary shall seek, to the maximum extent practicable, to avoid duplicative requirements from Federal and State governments to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology under this subchapter and subchapter XVIII. In doing so, the Secretary may deem satisfaction of requirements for such meaningful use for a payment year under subchapter XVIII to be sufficient to qualify as meaningful use under this subsection. The Secretary may also specify the reporting periods under this subsection in order to carry out this paragraph.

(B) The Secretary may waive, in certain limited cases, all or part of the reduction required under subparagraph (A) with respect to any State if such State is unable to reach the allowable error rate for a period or fiscal year despite a good faith effort by such State.

(C) In estimating the amount to be paid to a State under subsection (d) of this section, the Secretary shall take into consideration the limitation on Federal financial participation imposed by subparagraph (A) and shall reduce the estimate he makes under subsection (d)(1) of this section, for purposes of payment to the State under subsection (d)(3) of this section, in light of any expected erroneous excess payments for medical assistance (estimated in accordance with such criteria, including sampling procedures, as he may prescribe and subject to subsequent adjustment, if necessary, under subsection (d)(2) of this section).

(ii) In determining the amount of erroneous excess payments for medical assistance to an ineligible individual or family under clause (i)(I), if such ineligibility is the result of an error in determining the amount of the resources of such individual or family, the amount of the erroneous excess payment shall be the smaller of (I) the amount of the payment with respect to such individual or family, or (II) the difference between the actual amount of such resources and the allowable resource level established under the State plan.

(iii) In determining the amount of erroneous excess payments for medical assistance to an individual or family under clause (i)(II), the amount of the erroneous excess payment shall be the smaller of (I) the amount of the payment on behalf of the individual or family, or (II) the difference between the actual amount incurred for medical care by the individual or family and the amount which should have been incurred in order to establish eligibility for medical assistance.

(iv) In determining the amount of erroneous excess payments, there shall not be included any error resulting from a failure of an individual to cooperate or give correct information with respect to third-party liability as required under section 1396k(a)(1)(C) or 602(a)(26)(C) 4 of this title or with respect to payments made in violation of section 1396e of this title.

(ii) payments made as the result of a technical error.



(2) The State agency administering the plan approved under this subchapter shall, at such times and in such form as the Secretary may specify, provide information on the rates of erroneous excess payments made (or expected, with respect to future periods specified by the Secretary) in connection with its administration of such plan, together with any other data he requests that are reasonably necessary for him to carry out the provisions of this subsection.

(3)(A) If a State fails to cooperate with the Secretary in providing information necessary to carry out this subsection, the Secretary, directly or through contractual or such other arrangements as he may find appropriate, shall establish the error rates for that State on the basis of the best data reasonably available to him and in accordance with such techniques for sampling and estimating as he finds appropriate.

(B) In any case in which it is necessary for the Secretary to exercise his authority under subparagraph (A) to determine a State’s error rates for a fiscal year, the amount that would otherwise be payable to such State under this subchapter for quarters in such year shall be reduced by the costs incurred by the Secretary in making (directly or otherwise) such determination.

(IV) in the case of any other tax, the State establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the tax is imposed uniformly.


(ii) Subject to subparagraphs (D) and (E), a tax imposed with respect to a class of health care items and services is not considered to be imposed uniformly if the tax provides for any credits, exclusions, or deductions which have as their purpose or effect the return to providers of all or a portion of the tax paid in a manner that is inconsistent with subclauses (I) and (II) of subparagraph (E)(ii) or provides for a hold harmless provision described in paragraph (4).


(D) A tax imposed with respect to a class of health care items and services is considered to be imposed uniformly—(i) notwithstanding that the tax is not imposed with respect to items or services (or the providers thereof) for which payment is made under a State plan under this subchapter or subchapter XVIII of this chapter, or

(ii) in the case of a tax described in subparagraph (C)(i)(III), notwithstanding that the tax provides for exclusion (in whole or in part) of revenues or receipts from a State plan under this subchapter or subchapter XVIII of this chapter.

(II) the amount of the tax is not directly correlated to payments under this subchapter for items or services with respect to which the tax is imposed.


The Secretary shall by regulation specify types of credits, exclusions, and deductions that will be considered to meet the requirements of this subparagraph.


(F) In no case shall a tax not qualify as a broad-based health care related tax under this paragraph because it does not apply to a hospital that is described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of such Code and that does not accept payment under the State plan under this subchapter or under subchapter XVIII of this chapter.

(B) All or any portion of the payment made under this subchapter to the taxpayer varies based only upon the amount of the total tax paid.

(C)(i) The State or other unit of government imposing the tax provides (directly or indirectly) for any payment, offset, or waiver that guarantees to hold taxpayers harmless for any portion of the costs of the tax.

(II) the non-Federal share of the total amount estimated to be expended under the State plan during such State fiscal year.


(ii) For purposes of clause (i)(I), in the case of a tax that is not in effect throughout State fiscal year 1992 or the rate (or base) of which is increased during such fiscal year, the Secretary shall project the amount to be collected during such fiscal year as if the tax (or increase) were in effect during the entire State fiscal year.


(C)(i) The total amount of health care related taxes under subparagraph (B)(i)(I) shall be determined by the Secretary based on only those taxes (including the tax rate or base) which were in effect, or for which legislation or regulations imposing such taxes were enacted or adopted, as of November 22, 1991.

(ii) The amount of provider-related donations under subparagraph (B)(i)(I) shall be determined by the Secretary based on programs in effect on September 30, 1991, and applicable to State fiscal year 1992, as demonstrated by State plan amendments, written agreements, State budget documentation, or other documentary evidence in existence on that date.

(iii) The amount of expenditures described in subparagraph (B)(i)(II) shall be determined by the Secretary based on the best data available as of December 12, 1991.
