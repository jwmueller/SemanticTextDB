(2) for the performance of such other equivalent training, instruction, duty, or appropriate duties, as the Secretary may prescribe; or

(b) The regulations prescribed under subsection (a) for each uniformed service, the National Guard, and each of the classes of organization of the reserve components within each uniformed service, may be different. The Secretary concerned shall, for the National Guard and each of the classes of organization within each uniformed service, prescribe—(1) minimum standards that must be met before an assembly for drill or other equivalent period of training, instruction, duty, or appropriate duties may be credited for pay purposes, and those standards may require the presence for duty of officers and enlisted members in numbers equal to or more than a minimum number or percentage of the unit strength for a specified period of time with participation in a prescribed kind of training;

The compensation may be paid regardless of whether the course of instruction was under the direct control of the Secretary concerned or included the presence of an instructor.

(3) The prohibition in paragraph (1), including the prohibition as it relates to a member of the National Guard while not in Federal service, applies to—(A) any work or study performed on or after September 7, 1962, unless that work or study is specifically covered by the exception in paragraph (2); and

(B) any claim based on that work or study arising after that date.



(e) A member of the National Guard or of a reserve component of the uniformed services may not be paid under this section for more than four periods of equivalent training, instruction, duty, or appropriate duties performed during a fiscal year instead of the member’s regular period of instruction or regular period of appropriate duty during that fiscal year.

In subsection (a), the words “National Guard” are substituted for the words “National Guard, Air National Guard”, in section 301(a) of existing title 37, to conform to the definition of “National Guard” in section 101(6) of this revised title. The words “member of a reserve component of a uniformed service” are substituted for the words “National Guard of the United States, Air National Guard of the United States, Organized Reserve Corps, Naval Reserve, Air Force Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, Coast Guard Reserve, and the Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service,” since all of those organizations, or their successors, are the reserve components of the uniformed services. The words “who is not entitled to basic pay under section 204 of this title” are substituted for section 301(e) as (applicable to basic pay) of existing title 37. The words “of a corresponding grade” are inserted for clarity.
In subsection (b), the words “National Guard or reserve components” are substituted for the listing of organizations for the reasons set forth above. Reference to “classes of organization,” so far as they relate to the National Guard, are omitted, since there are no classes of organization of the National Guard.
