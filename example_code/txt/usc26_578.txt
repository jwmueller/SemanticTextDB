“If—“(1) a life insurance company owns the stock of another corporation through a partnership of which it is a partner,

“(2) the stock of the corporation was acquired on January 14, 1981, and

“(3) such stock was acquired by debt financing,


then, for purposes of determining the small life insurance company deduction under section 806a of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [formerly I.R.C. 1954] (as amended by this subtitle [subtitle A (§§ 211–219) of title II of div. A of Pub. L. 98–369, see Tables for classifications]), the amount of tentative LICTI of such life insurance company shall be computed without taking into account any income, gain, loss, or deduction attributable to the ownership of such stock. For purposes of determining taxable income, the amount of any income, gain, loss, or deduction attributable to the ownership of such stock shall be an amount equal to 46 times the amount of such income, gain, loss, or deduction, divided by 36.8.”
