“(d) To the extent that there is a conflict between the provisions of this section and any other Federal laws applicable to Alaska, the provisions of this section will govern. Any payment made to any corporation or any individual under authority of this section shall not be subject to any prior obligation under section 9(d) or 9(f) of the Settlement Act [section 1608(d) or section 1608(f) of this title].
