“SEC. 32703. REGULATIONS FOR IMPROVED OCCUPANT PROTECTION, PASSENGER EVACUATION, AND CRASH AVOIDANCE.“(a) Regulations Required Within 1 Year.—Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations requiring safety belts to be installed in motorcoaches at each designated seating position.

“(b) Regulations Required Within 2 Years.—Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations that address the following commercial motor vehicle standards, if the Secretary determines that such standards meet the requirements and considerations set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of section 30111 of title 49, United States Code:“(1) Roof strength and crush resistance.—The Secretary shall establish improved roof and roof support standards for motorcoaches that substantially improve the resistance of motorcoach roofs to deformation and intrusion to prevent serious occupant injury in rollover crashes involving motorcoaches.

“(2) Anti-ejection safety countermeasures.—The Secretary shall consider requiring advanced glazing standards for each motorcoach portal and shall consider other portal improvements to prevent partial and complete ejection of motorcoach passengers, including children. In prescribing such standards, the Secretary shall consider the impact of such standards on the use of motorcoach portals as a means of emergency egress.

“(3) Rollover crash avoidance.—The Secretary shall consider requiring motorcoaches to be equipped with stability enhancing technology, such as electronic stability control and torque vectoring, to reduce the number and frequency of rollover crashes among motorcoaches.


“(c) Commercial Motor Vehicle Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems.—Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall prescribe the following commercial vehicle regulation:“(1) In general.—The Secretary shall consider requiring motorcoaches to be equipped with direct tire pressure monitoring systems that warn the operator of a commercial motor vehicle when any tire exhibits a level of air pressure that is below a specified level of air pressure established by the Secretary, if the Secretary determines that such standards meet the requirements and considerations set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of section 30111 of title 49, United States Code.

“(2) Performance requirements.—In any standard adopted under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall include performance requirements to meet the objectives identified in paragraph (1) of this subsection.


“(d) Tire Performance Standard.—Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall consider—“(1) issuing a rule to upgrade performance standards for tires used on motorcoaches, including an enhanced endurance test and a new high-speed performance test; or

“(2) if the Secretary determines that a standard does not meet the requirements and considerations set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of section 30111 of title 49, United States Code, submit a report that describes the reasons for not prescribing such a standard to—“(A) the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate;

“(B) the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives; and

“(C) the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives.



“(e) Application of Regulations.—“(1) New motorcoaches.—Any regulation prescribed in accordance with subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) shall—“(A) apply to all motorcoaches manufactured more than 3 years after the date on which the regulation is published as a final rule;

“(B) take into account the impact to seating capacity of changes to size and weight of motorcoaches and the ability to comply with State and Federal size and weight requirements; and

“(C) be based on the best available science.


“(2) Retrofit assessment for existing motorcoaches.—“(A) In general.—The Secretary may assess the feasibility, benefits, and costs with respect to the application of any requirement established under subsection (a) or (b)(2) to motorcoaches manufactured before the date on which the requirement applies to new motorcoaches under paragraph (1).

“(B) Report.—The Secretary shall submit a report on the assessment to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act.
