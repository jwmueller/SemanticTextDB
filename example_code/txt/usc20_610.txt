(B) the lender or guaranty agency knew or should have known that its actions violated or failed to carry out the provisions of this part or the regulations thereunder.

The Secretary may only impose a single civil penalty for each such violation, failure, or substantial misrepresentation.


(5) Assignees not liable for violations by othersIf a loan affected by a violation, failure, or substantial misrepresentation is assigned to another holder, the lender or guaranty agency responsible for the violation, failure, or substantial misrepresentation shall remain liable for any civil money penalty provided for under paragraph (1) of this subsection, but the assignee shall not be liable for any such civil money penalty.
