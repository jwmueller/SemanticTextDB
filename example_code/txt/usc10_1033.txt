Historical and Revision Notes



1958 Act


Revised sectionSource (U.S. Code)Source (Statutes at Large)


1405[No source].[No source].


The amendment reflects section 11 of the Act of May 20, 1958, Pub. L. 85–422 (72 Stat. 130).

1962 ActThe change corrects a typographical error.

1982 ActThis amends 10:1405 to correct an inadvertent error in the codification of title 10 in 1956 relating to retirement pay of warrant officers advanced on the retired list. Under provisions of law first enacted in 1948 through the codification of title 10 in 1956 and until 1965, warrant officers advanced on the retired list received credit for inactive service in the computation of retirement pay. The Comptroller General in 1965 (B–156576) held in effect that computation of such retirement pay was governed by the wording of new title 10 that based the computation on years of active service only even though this had the result of making a substantive change. The Armed Services Committee of the House of Representatives concurs that an error was made in the codification of title 10 and has indicated that corrective legislative action is properly a responsibility of the House Judiciary Committee. See, also, the amendments to 10:3992 and 8992 made by sections 1(40) and 1(52), respectively.

(2).
1994—Subsec. (a)(3). Pub. L. 103–337, § 1662(j)(3), substituted “12733” for “1333” and “12731” for “1331”.
