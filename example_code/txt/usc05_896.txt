References in Text“Persons excluded by section 15 of the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act Amendments of 1966”, referred to in subsec. (c), means persons excluded by section 15 of Pub. L. 89–488, July 4, 1966, 80 Stat. 256, which was set out as a note under section 756 of former Title 5, Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees, prior to the 1966 revision of Title 5 by Pub.
