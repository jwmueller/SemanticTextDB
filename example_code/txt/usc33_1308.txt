References in TextThe Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, referred to in subsec. (a), is title II of Pub. L. 93–153, Nov. 16, 1973, 87 Stat. 584, which is classified generally to chapter 34 (§ 1651 et seq.) of Title 43, Public Lands. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 1651 of Title 43 and Tables.

Amendments1992—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 102–388 substituted “tanker loading cargo at” for “tank vessel operating on Prince William Sound, or” and directed the insertion of “and a response plan for such a facility,” after “(43 U.S.C. 1651 et seq.).”, which was executed by making the insertion after “(43 U.S.C. 1651 et seq.),” to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
