For complete classification of title XIII to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 4501 of this title and Tables.
Section 4615(c) of this title, referred to in subsec. (f), was repealed and a new section 4615(c) was added by Pub. L. 110–289, div. A, title I, § 1143(6), July 30, 2008, 122 Stat. 2734. The new section 4615(c) does not relate to effective date.
