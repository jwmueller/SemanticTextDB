§ 381. Carryovers in certain corporate acquisitions(a) General ruleIn the case of the acquisition of assets of a corporation by another corporation—(1) in a distribution to such other corporation to which section 332 (relating to liquidations of subsidiaries) applies; or

(2) in a transfer to which section 361 (relating to nonrecognition of gain or loss to corporations) applies, but only if the transfer is in connection with a reorganization described in subparagraph (A), (C), (D), (F), or (G) of section 368(a)(1),


the acquiring corporation shall succeed to and take into account, as of the close of the day of distribution or transfer, the items described in subsection (c) of the distributor or transferor corporation, subject to the conditions and limitations specified in subsections (b) and (c). For purposes of the preceding sentence, a reorganization shall be treated as meeting the requirements of subparagraph (D) or (G) of section 368(a)(1) only if the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 354(b)(1) are met.

(b) Operating rulesExcept in the case of an acquisition in connection with a reorganization described in subparagraph (F) of section 368(a)(1)—(1) The taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation shall end on the date of distribution or transfer.

(2) For purposes of this section, the date of distribution or transfer shall be the day on which the distribution or transfer is completed; except that, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the date when substantially all of the property has been distributed or transferred may be used if the distributor or transferor corporation ceases all operations, other than liquidating activities, after such date.

(3) The corporation acquiring property in a distribution or transfer described in subsection (a) shall not be entitled to carry back a net operating loss or a net capital loss for a taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer to a taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation.


(c) Items of the distributor or transferor corporationThe items referred to in subsection (a) are:(1) Net operating loss carryoversThe net operating loss carryovers determined under section 172, subject to the following conditions and limitations:(A) the taxable year of the acquiring corporation to which the net operating loss carryovers of the distributor or transferor corporation are first carried shall be the first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer.

(B) In determining the net operating loss deduction, the portion of such deduction attributable to the net operating loss carryovers of the distributor or transferor corporation to the first taxable year of the acquiring corporation ending after the date of distribution or transfer shall be limited to an amount which bears the same ratio to the taxable income (determined without regard to a net operating loss deduction) of the acquiring corporation in such taxable year as the number of days in the taxable year after the date of distribution or transfer bears to the total number of days in the taxable year.

(C) For the purpose of determining the amount of the net operating loss carryovers under section 172(b)(2), a net operating loss for a taxable year (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as the “loss year”) of a distributor or transferor corporation which ends on or before the end of a loss year of the acquiring corporation shall be considered to be a net operating loss for a year prior to such loss year of the acquiring corporation. For the same purpose, the taxable income for a “prior taxable year” (as the term is used in section 172(b)(2)) shall be computed as provided in such section; except that, if the date of distribution or transfer is on a day other than the last day of a taxable year of the acquiring corporation—(i) such taxable year shall (for the purpose of this subparagraph only) be considered to be 2 taxable years (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as the “pre-acquisition part year” and the “post-acquisition part year”);

(ii) the pre-acquisition part year shall begin on the same day as such taxable year begins and shall end on the date of distribution or transfer;

(iii) the post-acquisition part year shall begin on the day following the date of distribution or transfer and shall end on the same day as the end of such taxable year;

(iv) the taxable income for such taxable year (computed with the modifications specified in section 172(b)(2)(A) but without a net operating loss deduction) shall be divided between the pre-acquisition part year and the post-acquisition part year in proportion to the number of days in each;

(v) the net operating loss deduction for the pre-acquisition part year shall be determined as provided in section 172(b)(2)(B), but without regard to a net operating loss year of the distributor or transferor corporation; and

(vi) the net operating loss deduction for the post-acquisition part year shall be determined as provided in section 172(b)(2)(B).

(B) a deficit in earnings and profits of the distributor, transferor, or acquiring corporation shall be used only to offset earnings and profits accumulated after the date of transfer. For this purpose, the earnings and profits for the taxable year of the acquiring corporation in which the distribution or transfer occurs shall be deemed to have been accumulated after such distribution or transfer in an amount which bears the same ratio to the undistributed earnings and profits of the acquiring corporation for such taxable year (computed without regard to any earnings and profits received from the distributor or transferor corporation, as described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph) as the number of days in the taxable year after the date of distribution or transfer bears to the total number of days in the taxable year.

(C) For purposes of determining the amount of such capital loss carryover to taxable years following the taxable year determined under subparagraph (A), the capital gain net income in the taxable year determined under subparagraph (A) shall be considered to be an amount equal to the amount determined under subparagraph (B).


(4) Method of accountingThe acquiring corporation shall use the method of accounting used by the distributor or transferor corporation on the date of distribution or transfer unless different methods were used by several distributor or transferor corporations or by a distributor or transferor corporation and the acquiring corporation. If different methods were used, the acquiring corporation shall use the method or combination of methods of computing taxable income adopted pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary.


(5) InventoriesIn any case in which inventories are received by the acquiring corporation, such inventories shall be taken by such corporation (in determining its income) on the same basis on which such inventories were taken by the distributor or transferor corporation, unless different methods were used by several distributor or transferor corporations or by a distributor or transferor corporation and the acquiring corporation. If different methods were used, the acquiring corporation shall use the method or combination of methods of taking inventory adopted pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

“(a) Filing of Statement.—If—“(1) the amount of any tax required to be paid for any taxable year ending on or before the date of the enactment of this Act [June 15, 1955] is increased by reason of the enactment of this Act [amending this section and repealing sections 452 and 462], and

“(2) the last date prescribed for payment of such tax (or any installment thereof) is before December 15, 1955, then the taxpayer shall, on or before December 15, 1955, file a statement which shows the increase in the amount of such tax required to be paid by reason of the enactment of this Act.


“(b) Form and Effect of Statement.—“(1) Form of statement, etc.—The statement required by subsection (a) shall be filed at the place fixed for filing the return. Such statement shall be in such form, and shall include such information necessary or appropriate to show the increase in the amount of the tax required to be paid for the taxable year by reason of the enactment of this Act, as the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate shall by regulations prescribe.

“(2) Treatment as amount shown on return.—The amount shown on a statement filed under subsection (a) as the increase in the amount of the tax required to be paid for the taxable year by reason of the enactment of this Act shall, for all purposes of the internal revenue laws, be treated as tax shown on the return. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, that portion of the amount of increase in tax for any taxable year which is attributable to a decrease (by reason of the enactment of this Act) in the net operating loss for a succeeding taxable year shall not be treated as tax shown on the return.

“(3) Waiver of interest in case of payment on or before december 15, 1955.—If the taxpayer, on or before December 15, 1955, files the statement referred to in subsection (a) and pays in full that portion of the amount shown thereon for which the last date prescribed for payment is before December 15, 1955, then for purposes of computing interest (other than interest on overpayments) such portion shall be treated as having been paid on the last date prescribed for payment. This paragraph shall not apply if the amount shown on the statement as the increase in the amount of the tax required to be paid for the taxable year by reason of the enactment of this Act is greater than the actual increase unless the taxpayer establishes, to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate, that his computation of the greater amount was based upon a reasonable interpretation and application of sections 452 and 462 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [formerly I.R.C. 1954] [sections 452 and 462 of this title], as those sections existed before the enactment of this Act.

“(2) Estimated tax.—Any addition to the tax under section 294(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 [section 294(d) of former Title 26, Internal Revenue Code], shall be computed as if this Act had not been enacted. In the case of any installment for which the last date prescribed for payment is before December 15, 1955, any addition to the tax under section 6654 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [section 6654 of this title], shall be computed as if this Act had not been enacted.

“(3) Treatment of certain payments which taxpayer is required to make.—If—“(A) the taxpayer is required to make a payment (or an additional payment) to another person by reason of the enactment of this Act, and

“(B) the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [this title] prescribes a period, which expires after the close of the taxable year, within which the taxpayer must make such payment (or additional payment) if the amount thereof is to be taken into account (as a deduction or otherwise) in computing taxable income for such taxable year,


then, subject to such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate may prescribe, if such payment (or additional payment) is made on or before December 15, 1955, it shall be treated as having been made within the period prescribed by such Code.

“(4) Treatment of certain dividends.—Subject to such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate may prescribe, for purposes of section 561(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [section 561(a)(1) of this title], dividends paid after the 15th day of the third month following the close of the taxable year and on or before December 15, 1955, may be treated as having been paid on the last day of the taxable year, but only to the extent (A) that such dividends are attributable to an increase in taxable income for the taxable year resulting from the enactment of this Act, and (B) elected by the taxpayer.

“(5) Determination of date prescribed.—For purposes of this section, the determination of the last date prescribed for payment or for filing a return shall be made without regard to any extension of time therefor and without regard to any provision of this section.

“(6) Regulations.—For requirement that the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate shall prescribe all rules and regulations as may be necessary by reason of the enactment of this Act, see section 7805(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [section 7805(a) of this title].”
