§ 2108. Proof of amount in controversy
Where the power of any court of appeals to review a case depends upon the amount or value in controversy, such amount or value, if not otherwise satisfactorily disclosed upon the record, may be shown and ascertained by the oath of a party to the case or by other competent evidence.
(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 963.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 231 (Feb. 13, 1925, ch. 229, § 9, 43 Stat. 941).
Words “or in the Supreme Court” were omitted. Section 7 of the 1925 act containing such words related to review by the Supreme Court of the United States of decisions of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands and designated a certain jurisdictional amount. Such section 7 has now become obsolete, in view of the recognition of the independence of the Philippines, title 48 U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 1240, Territories and Insular Possessions, and there is no other case wherein the power of the Supreme Court to review depends on the amount or value in controversy.
