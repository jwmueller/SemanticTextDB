“SEC. 2. FINDINGS.“The Congress makes the following findings:“(1) After decades of apartheid, South Africa has entered a new era which presents a historic opportunity for a transition to a peaceful, stable, and democratic future.

“(2) The United States policy of economic sanctions toward the apartheid government of South Africa, as expressed in the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 [22 U.S.C. 5001 et seq.], helped bring about reforms in that system of government and has facilitated the establishment of a nonracial government.

“(3) Through broad and open negotiations, the parties in South Africa have reached a landmark agreement on the future of their country. This agreement includes the establishment of a Transitional Executive Council and the setting of a date for nonracial elections.

“(4) The international community has a vital interest in supporting the transition from apartheid toward nonracial democracy.

“(5) The success of the transition in South Africa is crucial to the stability and economic development of the southern African region.

“(6) Nelson Mandela of the African National Congress and other representative leaders in South Africa have declared that the time has come when the international community should lift all economic sanctions against South Africa.

“(7) In light of recent developments, the continuation of these economic sanctions is detrimental to persons disadvantaged by apartheid.

“(8) Those calling for the lifting of economic sanctions against South Africa have made clear that they do not seek the immediate termination of the United Nations-sponsored special sanctions relating to arms transfers, nuclear cooperation, and exports of oil. The Ad Hoc Committee on Southern Africa of the Organization of African Unity, for example, has urged that the oil embargo established pursuant to a 1986 General Assembly resolution be lifted after the establishment and commencement of the work of the Transitional Executive Council.
