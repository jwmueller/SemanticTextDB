In this chapter, the word “disabled” is substituted for “handicapped” for consistency with the name of the Committee. The word “product” is substituted for “commodity” to reflect the current usage of the items produced in the Committee’s program.
In this section, the text of 41:48b(6) is omitted as unnecessary.
In paragraph (9), the words “the Northern Mariana Islands” are substituted for “the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands” because the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands terminated. See 48 U.S.C. note prec. 1681. However, section 502(a)(2) of the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America (48 U.S.C. 1801 note) provided that laws in existence on the effective date of section 502 that were applicable to Guam and that were of general application to the several States would apply to the Northern Mariana Islands. The Marshall Islands, Palau, and the Federated States of Micronesia are not included because although they were part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, they are independent entities and not part of the United States.
