The preceding sentence shall not apply for any fiscal year for which no Federal assistance is provided to Amtrak.

(c) Conflicts of Interest.—When employed by Amtrak, an officer may not have a financial or employment relationship with another rail carrier, except that holding securities issued by a rail carrier is not deemed to be a violation of this subsection if the officer holding the securities makes a complete public disclosure of the holdings and does not participate in any decision directly affecting the rail carrier.
