Section 9302 sets forth the requirements for pilots on the waters of the Great Lakes under the jurisdiction of the United States or Canada.
Subsection (a) requires each United States vessel sailing on register and each foreign vessel to engage a United States or Canadian registered pilot who shall direct the navigation of the vessel in designated waters of the Great Lakes or be available to direct the navigation of the vessel in undesignated waters of the Great Lakes. The President must make the designation with regard to public interest, effective use of navigable waters, marine safety, and United States foreign relations. The direction of the vessel by an authorized pilot is subject to the customary authority of the master.
Subsection (b) provides that a crewmember licensed for Great Lakes navigation under section 7101 or equivalent Canadian law may serve as the pilot on undesignated waters.
Subsection (c) provides for reciprocity of recognizing United States and Canadian pilots.
Subsections (d) and (e) are exceptions to subsection (a). Subsection (d) permits operation of a vessel on the Great Lakes without a registered pilot if notice is given that one is not available or if the vessel or cargo is in distress or jeopardy. Subsection (e) exempts a Canadian vessel in the coastwise or Great Lakes trade from the requirement of having a registered pilot if similar United States vessels are extended the same exemption by Canada.
