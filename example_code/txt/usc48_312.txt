§ 738. Free interchange of merchandise with United States
All merchandise and articles coming into the United States from Puerto Rico and coming into Puerto Rico from the United States shall be entered at the several ports of entry free of duty and in no event shall any tariff duties be collected on said merchandise or articles.
(Apr. 12, 1900, ch. 191, § 3, 31 Stat. 77; May 17, 1932, ch. 190, 47 Stat. 158.)

Codification
Act Apr. 12, 1900, § 3, as originally enacted, imposed tariff duties, amounting to 15 per centum of the duties on like articles imported from foreign countries, on all articles of merchandise coming into the United States from Porto Rico and vice versa. Merchandise and articles except coffee, not dutiable under United States’ tariff laws, and merchandise or articles entered in Porto Rico free of duty under orders theretofore made by the Secretary of War, were to be admitted from the United States free of duty, all laws or parts of laws to the contrary, notwithstanding. However, all of the aforesaid tariff duties were to cease, and the provisions in the text were to become operative, whenever the local legislative assembly should put into operation a system of local taxation, and the President should make proclamation thereof. In no event were those duties to be collected after March 1, 1902. In accordance with the aforesaid provision President McKinley issued his proclamation July 25, 1901, 32 Stat. 1983.
Section 3 also contained provisions relating to a tax on merchandise of Porto Rican manufacture equal to the internal-revenue tax imposed in the United States, and on merchandise of United States manufacture coming into Porto Rico, a tax equal to the internal-revenue tax imposed in Porto Rico upon like articles of Porto Rican manufacture which are contained in sections 7652 and 7653 of Title 26, Internal Revenue Code.
Section was not enacted as part of the Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act which comprises this chapter.


Change of Name
“Puerto Rico” substituted in text for “Porto Rico” pursuant to act May 17, 1932, which is classified to section 731a of this title.
