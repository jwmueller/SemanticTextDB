(3) Amount of grant(A) In generalSubject to the extent of amounts made available in appropriations Acts, a grant made for purposes of this paragraph to an eligible area shall be made in an amount equal to the product of—(i) an amount equal to the amount available for distribution under paragraph (2) for the fiscal year involved; and

(ii) the percentage constituted by the ratio of the distribution factor for the eligible area to the sum of the respective distribution factors for all eligible areas;


which product shall then, as applicable, be increased under paragraph (4).

(C) Living cases of HIV/AIDS(i) Requirement of names-based reportingExcept as provided in clause (ii), the number determined under this subparagraph for an eligible area for a fiscal year for purposes of subparagraph (B) is the number of living names-based cases of HIV/AIDS that, as of December 31 of the most recent calendar year for which such data is available, have been reported to and confirmed by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.


(ii) Transition period; exemption regarding non-AIDS casesFor each of the fiscal years 2007 through 2012, an eligible area is, subject to clauses (iii) through (v), exempt from the requirement under clause (i) that living names-based non-AIDS cases of HIV be reported unless—(I) a system was in operation as of December 31, 2005, that provides sufficiently accurate and reliable names-based reporting of such cases throughout the State in which the area is located, subject to clause (viii); or

(II) no later than the beginning of fiscal year 2008 or a subsequent fiscal year through fiscal year 2012, the Secretary, in consultation with the chief executive of the State in which the area is located, determines that a system has become operational in the State that provides sufficiently accurate and reliable names-based reporting of such cases throughout the State.

(bb) all statutory changes necessary to provide for sufficiently accurate and reliable reporting of such cases had been made; and


(II) the State had agreed that, by April 1, 2008, the State will begin accurate and reliable names-based reporting of such cases, except that such agreement is not required to provide that, as of such date, the system for such reporting be fully sufficient with respect to accuracy and reliability throughout the area.


(iv) Requirement for exemption as of fiscal year 2008For each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2012, an exemption under clause (ii) for an eligible area applies only if, as of April 1, 2008, the State in which the area is located is substantially in compliance with the agreement under clause (iii)(II).

(vi) Counting of cases in areas with exemptions(I) In generalWith respect to an eligible area that is under a reporting system for living non-AIDS cases of HIV that is not names-based (referred to in this subparagraph as “code-based reporting”), the Secretary shall, for purposes of this subparagraph, modify the number of such cases reported for the eligible area in order to adjust for duplicative reporting in and among systems that use code-based reporting.


(II) Adjustment rateThe adjustment rate under subclause (I) for an eligible area shall be a reduction of 5 percent for fiscal years before fiscal year 2012 (and 6 percent for fiscal year 2012) in the number of living non-AIDS cases of HIV reported for the area.


(III) Increased adjustment for certain areas previously using code-based reportingFor purposes of this subparagraph for each of fiscal years 2010 through 2012, the Secretary shall deem the applicable number of living cases of HIV/AIDS in an area that were reported to and confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be 3 percent higher than the actual number if—(aa) for fiscal year 2007, such area was a transitional area;

(bb) fiscal year 2007 was the first year in which the count of living non-AIDS cases of HIV in such area, for purposes of this section, was based on a names-based reporting system; and

(cc) the amount of funding that such area received under this part for fiscal year 2007 was less than 70 percent of the amount of funding (exclusive of funds that were identified as being for purposes of the Minority AIDS Initiative) that such area received under such part for fiscal year 2006.



(vii) Multiple political jurisdictionsWith respect to living non-AIDS cases of HIV, if an eligible area is not entirely within one political jurisdiction and as a result is subject to more than one reporting system for purposes of this subparagraph:(I) Names-based reporting under clause (i) applies in a jurisdictional portion of the area, or an exemption under clause (ii) applies in such portion (subject to applicable provisions of this subparagraph), according to whether names-based reporting or code-based reporting is used in such portion.

(II) If under subclause (I) both names-based reporting and code-based reporting apply in the area, the number of code-based cases shall be reduced under clause (vi).


(viii) List of eligible areas meeting standard regarding December 31, 2005(I) In generalIf an eligible area or portion thereof is in a State specified in subclause (II), the eligible area or portion shall be considered to meet the standard described in clause (ii)(I).

(II) Applicability of exemption requirementsThe provisions of clauses (ii) through (viii) may not be construed as having any legal effect for fiscal year 2013 or any subsequent fiscal year, and accordingly, the status of a State for purposes of such clauses may not be considered after fiscal year 2012.



(x) Program for detecting inaccurate or fraudulent countingThe Secretary shall carry out a program to monitor the reporting of names-based cases for purposes of this subparagraph and to detect instances of inaccurate reporting, including fraudulent reporting.


(xi) Future fiscal yearsFor fiscal years beginning with fiscal year 2013, determinations under this paragraph shall be based only on living names-based cases of HIV/AIDS with respect to the area involved.
