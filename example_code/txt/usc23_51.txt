“(F) assess the cost effectiveness of projects funded under the program with respect to congestion mitigation;

“(G) compare—“(i) the costs of achieving the air pollutant emissions reductions achieved under the program; to

“(ii) the costs that would be incurred if similar reductions were achieved by other measures, including pollution controls on stationary sources;


“(H) include recommendations on improvements, including other types of projects, that will increase the overall effectiveness of the program;

“(I) include recommendations on expanding the scope of the program to address traffic-related pollutants that, as of the date of the study, are not addressed by the program.


“(2) Report.—Not later than January 1, 2000, the National Academy of Sciences shall transmit to the Secretary, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Commerce of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate a report on the results of the study with recommendations for modifications to the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program in light of the results of the study.

“(3) Funding.—Before making the apportionment of funds under [former] section 104(b)(2) of title 23, United States Code, for each of fiscal years 1999 and 2000, the Secretary shall deduct from the amount to be apportioned under such section for such fiscal year, and make available, $500,000 for such fiscal year to carry out this subsection.”
