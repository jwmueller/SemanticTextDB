In paragraph (1), the words “of America” are omitted as unnecessary.
In paragraph (2), the word “agency” is substituted for “Government agency”. The term “Executive agency” is substituted for the reference to “each executive department of the Government, each independent establishment or agency in the executive branch of the Government, including each corporation wholly owned (either directly or through one or more corporations) by the Government”. The exception of “a Government controlled corporation” is added to preserve the application of this subchapter to corporations wholly owned by the Government.
In paragraph (3), the word “employee” is substituted for “individual in the civilian service” in view of the definition of “employee” in section 2105. Reference to “ambassadors, ministers, and officers of the Foreign Service under the Department of State” is omitted as included in the definition of “employee”.
In paragraph (4), the words “of the United States of America” are omitted as unnecessary.
Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
