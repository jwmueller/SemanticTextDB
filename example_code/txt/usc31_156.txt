1534(b)31:628a(last sentence).


In subsection (a), the words “Subject to limitations applicable with respect to each appropriation concerned” are omitted as surplus. The words “or any bureau or office thereof” are omitted as being included in “agency”. The words “to pay costs” are substituted for “for the purpose of financing the procurement of materials and services, or financing other costs” to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsection (b), the words “amounts paid under this section” are substituted for “such expenses so financed”, and the words “appropriations charged under subsection (a) of this section” are substituted for “financing appropriation”, for clarity.
