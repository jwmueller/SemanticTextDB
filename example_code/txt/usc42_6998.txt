(b) Program goalsThe goals of the program established under subsection (a) of this section shall include—(1) in the buildings sector—(A) to accelerate the development of technologies that will increase energy efficiency;

(B) to increase the use of renewable energy; and

(C) to reduce environmental impacts;


(2) in the industrial sector—(A) to accelerate the development of technologies that will increase energy efficiency in order to improve productivity;

(B) to increase the use of renewable energy; and

(C) to reduce environmental impacts; and


(3) in the utility sector—(A) to accelerate the development of technologies that will increase energy efficiency; and

(B) to increase the use of integrated resource planning.



(c) Program planWithin 180 days after October 24, 1992, the Secretary shall prepare and submit to the Congress a 5-year program plan to guide activities under this part. In preparing the program plan, the Secretary shall consult with appropriate representatives of industry, utilities, institutions of higher education, Federal agencies, including national laboratories, and professional and technical societies.


(d) ProposalsWithin 1 year after October 24, 1992, the Secretary shall solicit proposals for conducting activities under this section.


(e) Authorization of appropriationsThere are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary for carrying out this part, including all building, industry, and utility sectors energy conservation research and development, and inventions and innovation under energy conservation technical and financial assistance, $178,250,000 for fiscal year 1993 and $275,000,000 for fiscal year 1994.
