“(a)(1) The amount payable to the Secretary by a State for any fiscal year, other than fiscal year 1974, pursuant to its agreement or agreements under section 1616 of the Social Security Act [this section] shall not exceed the non-Federal share of expenditures as aid or assistance for quarters in the calendar year 1972 under the plans of the State approved under titles I, X, XIV, and XVI of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq., 1201 et seq., 1351 et seq., 1381 et seq.] (as defined in subsection (c) of this section), and the amount payable for fiscal year 1974 pursuant to such agreement or agreements shall not exceed one-half of the non-Federal share of such expenditures.

“(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection shall only apply with respect to that portion of the supplementary payments made by the Secretary on behalf of the State under such agreements in any fiscal year which does not exceed in the case of any individual the difference between—“(A) the adjusted payment level under the appropriate approved plan of such State as in effect for January 1972 (as defined in subsection (b) of this section), and

“(B) the benefits under title XVI of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.] (subject to the second sentence of this paragraph), plus income not excluded under section 1612(b) of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1382a(b)] in determining such benefits, paid to such individual in such fiscal year,


and shall not apply with respect to supplementary payments to any individual who (i) is not required by section 1616 of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1382e] to be included in any such agreement administered by the Secretary and (ii) would have been ineligible (for reasons other than income) for payments under the appropriate approved State plan as in effect for January 1972. In determining the difference between the level specified in subparagraph (A) and the benefits and income described in subparagraph (B) there shall be excluded any part of any such benefit which results from (and would not be payable but for) any cost-of-living increase in such benefits under section 1617 of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1382f] (or any general increase enacted by law in the dollar amounts referred to in such section) becoming effective after June 30, 1977.


“(b)(1) For purposes of subsection (a), the term ‘adjusted payment level under the appropriate approved plan of a State as in effect for January 1972’ means the amount of the money payment which an individual with no other income would have received under the plan of such State approved under title I, X, XIV, or XVI of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq., 1201 et seq., 1351 et seq., 1381 et seq.], as may be appropriate, and in effect for January 1972; except that the State may, at its option, increase such payment level with respect to any such plan by an amount which does not exceed the sum of—“(A) a payment level modification (as defined in paragraph (2) of this subsection) with respect to such plan, and

“(B) the bonus value of food stamps [probably should be “benefits”] in such State for January 1972 (as defined in paragraph (3) of this subsection).


“(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term ‘payment level modification’ with respect to any State plan means that amount by which a State which for January 1972 made money payments under such plan to individuals with no other income which were less than 100 per centum of its standard of need could have increased such money payments without increasing (if it reduced its standard of need under such plan so that such increased money payments equaled 100 per centum of such standard of need) the non-Federal share of expenditures as aid or assistance for quarters in calendar year 1972 under the plans of such State approved under titles I, X, XIV, and XVI of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq., 1201 et seq., 1351 et seq., 1381 et seq.].

“(3) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term ‘bonus value of benefits in a State for January 1972’ (with respect to an individual) means—“(A) the face value of the benefit allotment which would have been provided to such an individual under the Food Stamp Act of 1964 [now the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, 7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.] for January 1972, reduced by

“(B) the charge which such an individual would have paid for such benefit allotment,


if the income of such individual, for purposes of determining the charge it would have paid for its benefit allotment, had been equal to the adjusted payment level under the State plan (including any payment level modification with respect to the plan adopted pursuant to paragraph (2) (but not including any amount under this paragraph)). The total face value of benefits and the cost thereof in January 1972 shall be determined in accordance with rules prescribed by the Secretary of Agriculture in effect in such month.


“(c) For purposes of this section, the term ‘non-Federal share of expenditures as aid or assistance for quarters in the calendar year 1972 under the plans of a State approved under titles I, X, XIV, and XVI of the Social Security Act’ [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq., 1201 et seq., 1351 et seq., 1381 et seq.] means the difference between—“(1) the total expenditures in such quarters under such plans for aid or assistance (excluding expenditures authorized under section 1119 of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1319] for repairing the home of an individual who was receiving aid or assistance under one of such plans (as such section was in effect prior to the enactment of this Act)), and

“(2) the total of the amounts determined under sections 3, 1003, 1403, and 1603 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 303, 1203, 1353; 1383 note], under section 1118 of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1318], and under section 9 of the Act of April 19, 1950 [25 U.S.C. 639], for such State with respect to such expenditures in such quarters.


“(d) In addition to the amount which a State must pay to the Secretary for the fiscal year 1983 or the fiscal year 1984, as determined under subsection (a), the State shall also pay, for the fiscal year 1983, 60 percent of the further amount that would be payable but for the limit specified in subsection (a), and, for the fiscal year 1984, 80 percent of such further amount. For each fiscal year thereafter, the limit prescribed in subsection (a) shall be inapplicable and a State shall pay to the Secretary the full amount of any supplementary payments he makes on behalf of such State.”
