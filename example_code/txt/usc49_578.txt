In subsection (a), the word “determining” is substituted for “reckoning” for clarity. The words “who are not or may hereafter be employed” are omitted as surplus. In clause (1), the words “or territory” are omitted because the existing territories of the United States are now connected to the United States by rail. In clause (2), the words “or possession of the United States” are added for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.
The text of sections 2 and 3 of the Act of September 3, 5, 1916 (ch. 436, 39 Stat. 721), is omitted to eliminate executed provisions.
