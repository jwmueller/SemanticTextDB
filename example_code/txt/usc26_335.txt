§ 356. Receipt of additional consideration(a) Gain on exchanges(1) Recognition of gainIf—(A) section 354 or 355 would apply to an exchange but for the fact that

The remainder, if any, of the gain recognized under paragraph (1) shall be treated as gain from the exchange of property.



(b) Additional consideration received in certain distributionsIf—(1) section 355 would apply to a distribution but for the fact that

(2) the property received in the distribution consists not only of property permitted by section 355 to be received without the recognition of gain, but also of other property or money,


then an amount equal to the sum of such money and the fair market value of such other property shall be treated as a distribution of property to which section 301 applies.

(2) the property received in the exchange or distribution consists not only of property permitted by section 354 or 355 to be received without the recognition of gain or loss, but also of other property or money,

(ii) the principal amount of such securities received exceeds the principal amount of such securities surrendered,


then, with respect to such securities received, the term “other property” means only the fair market value of such excess. For purposes of this subparagraph and subparagraph (C) if no securities are surrendered, the excess shall be the entire principal amount of the securities received.

(C) Greater principal amount in section 355 transactionIf, in an exchange or distribution described in section 355, the principal amount of the securities in the controlled corporation which are received exceeds the principal amount of the securities in the distributing corporation which are surrendered, then, with respect to such securities received, the term “other property” means only the fair market value of such excess.
