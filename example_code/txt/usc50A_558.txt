The President shall appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, two Assistant Secretaries of Commerce to assist the Under Secretary in carrying out such functions.


(b) Issuance of regulationsThe President and the Secretary may issue such regulations as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix]. Any such regulations issued to carry out the provisions of section 5(a), 6(a), 7(a), or 8(b) [section 2404(a), 2405(a), 2406(a), or 2407(b) of this Appendix] may apply to the financing, transporting, or other servicing of exports and the participation therein by any person.

The preceding sentence does not require the concurrence or approval of any official, department, or agency to which such regulations are submitted.


(c) Amendments to regulationsIf the Secretary proposes to amend regulations issued under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix], the Secretary shall report to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives on the intent and rationale of such amendments. Such report shall evaluate the cost and burden to United States exporters of the proposed amendments in relation to any enhancement of licensing objectives. The Secretary shall consult with the technical advisory committees authorized under section 5(h) of this Act [section 2404(h) of this Appendix] in formulating or amending regulations issued under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix]. The procedures defined by regulations in effect on January 1, 1984, with respect to sections 4 and 5 of this Act [sections 2403 and 2404 of this Appendix], shall remain in effect unless the Secretary determines, on the basis of substantial and reliable evidence, that specific change is necessary to enhance the prevention of diversions of exports which would prove detrimental to the national security of the United States or to reduce the licensing and paperwork burden on exporters and their distributors.
