In the chapter, the words “Secretary of Transportation” and “Secretary” are substituted for “Administrator” in the provisions of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Pub. L. 85–726, 72 Stat. 731) restated in the revised chapter because of the transfer of aviation functions to the Secretary under 49:1655(c)(1).
In subsection (a), the words “may prescribe regulations to carry out the duties and powers” are substituted for “may make such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out . . . functions, powers, and duties” for consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words. The text of 49:1657(f) and (g) is omitted as executed because the transfer of personnel, assets, and liabilities, etc., has been accomplished.
In subsection (b), the words “Except where this chapter vests in any administration, agency or board, specific functions, powers, and duties” before “the Secretary may” in 49:1657(e)(1) are omitted because of the specific wording of sections 103, 104, and 106 of the revised title. The words “in addition to the authority to delegate and redelegate contained in any other Act in the exercise of the functions transferred to or vested in the Secretary in this chapter” before “delegate” in 49:1657(e)(1) are omitted because the authority of the Secretary to delegate is consolidated in the subsection.

July 1, 1968, 82 Stat. 1369), for clarity and consistency. The words “as he may designate” and “of such functions, powers, and duties as he may deem desirable” are omitted as surplus each place they appear in 49:1657(e)(1) and (2).

The text of 49:1657(e)(2) (words before 2d comma) is omitted as unnecessary because the authority of an officer to delegate is consolidated in the subsection. The words “the duties and powers of the officer” are substituted for “such functions, powers, and duties” in 49:1657(e)(2) for clarity and consistency. The words “the duties and powers specified in sections 103(c)(1), 104(c)(1), and 106(g)(1) of this title” are substituted for “any of the statutory duties and responsibilities specifically assigned to them by this chapter” in 49:1657(e)(3) for clarity. The words “may not be delegated to an officer or employee outside the Administration concerned” are substituted for “The Administrators established by section 1652(e) of this title . . . may not delegate . . . outside of their respective administrations” in 49:1657(e)(3) for clarity and because of the restatement of the section.
In subsection (c), before clause (1), the words “aviation duties and powers” are added because the source provisions being restated only applies to carrying out duties and powers related to the Federal Aviation Administration.

The words “at the seat of government and elsewhere as may be necessary” after “expenditures” and “and as from time to time may be appropriated for by Congress” are omitted as surplus.

The words “such . . . as is necessary in the exercise and performance of the powers and duties of the Secretary” after “aircraft” in 49:1344(a) are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement of the section. The text of 49:1344(a) (proviso) is omitted as unnecessary.
