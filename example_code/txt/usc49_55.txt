Review of the order shall be based on a determination of whether the Secretary’s findings and conclusions were supported by substantial evidence, or were otherwise not in accordance with law. No objection that has not been urged before the Secretary shall be considered by the court, unless reasonable grounds existed for failure or neglect to do so. The commencement of proceedings under this subsection shall not, unless ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the order of the Secretary.

Minimum and Maximum AssessmentsPub. L. 106–159, title II, § 222, Dec. 9, 1999, 113 Stat. 1769, provided that:
“(a) In General.—The Secretary of Transportation should ensure that motor carriers operate safely by imposing civil penalties at a level calculated to ensure prompt and sustained compliance with Federal motor carrier safety and commercial driver’s license laws.

“(b) Establishment.—The Secretary—“(1) should establish and assess minimum civil penalties for each violation of a law referred to in subsection (a); and

“(2) shall assess the maximum civil penalty for each violation of a law referred to in subsection (a) by any person who is found to have committed a pattern of violations of critical or acute regulations issued to carry out such a law or to have previously committed the same or a related violation of critical or acute regulations issued to carry out such a law.


“(c) Extraordinary Circumstances.—If the Secretary determines and documents that extraordinary circumstances exist which merit the assessment of any civil penalty lower than any level established under subsection (b), the Secretary may assess such lower penalty. In cases where a person has been found to have previously committed the same or a related violation of critical or acute regulations issued to carry out a law referred to in subsection (a), extraordinary circumstances may be found to exist when the Secretary determines that repetition of such violation does not demonstrate a failure to take appropriate remedial action.

“(d) Report to Congress.—“(1) In general.—The Secretary shall conduct a study of the effectiveness of the revised civil penalties established in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century [Pub. L. 105–178, see Tables for classification] and this Act [see Tables for classification] in ensuring prompt and sustained compliance with Federal motor carrier safety and commercial driver’s license laws.

“(2) Submission to congress.—The Secretary shall transmit the results of such study and any recommendations to Congress by September 30, 2002.”





Report; Penalties; EffectivenessSection 213(d) of Pub. L. 98–554 directed Secretary of Transportation to conduct a study of effectiveness of civil and criminal penalties established by amendments made by section 213 of Pub. L. 98–554 in deterring violations of commercial motor vehicle safety regulations issued under title II of Pub. L. 98–554 and in effectively prosecuting such violations when they occur, which study was to examine the effectiveness of penalties in effect before Oct. 30, 1984, in comparison to the penalties established by the amendments made by title II of Pub. L. 98–554, and was to further investigate the need for, and make recommendations concerning, increased fine levels for civil and criminal penalties, and the need for additional categories of civil and criminal penalties to deter further, and prosecute effectively, violations of such commercial motor vehicle safety regulations, and further directed Secretary to submit to Congress a report on the findings of this study, together with legislative recommendations, not later than 2 years after Oct. 30, 1984.
