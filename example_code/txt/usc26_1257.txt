§ 4942. Taxes on failure to distribute income(a) Initial taxThere is hereby imposed on the undistributed income of a private foundation for any taxable year, which has not been distributed before the first day of the second (or any succeeding) taxable year following such taxable year (if such first day falls within the taxable period), a tax equal to 30 percent of the amount of such income remaining undistributed at the beginning of such second (or succeeding) taxable year. The tax imposed by this subsection shall not apply to the undistributed income of a private foundation—(1) for any taxable year for which it is an operating foundation (as defined in subsection (j)(3)), or

(2) to the extent that the foundation failed to distribute any amount solely because of an incorrect valuation of assets under subsection (e), if—(A) the failure to value the assets properly was not willful and was due to reasonable cause,

(B) such amount is distributed as qualifying distributions (within the meaning of subsection (g)) by the foundation during the allowable distribution period (as defined in subsection (j)(2)),

(C) the foundation notifies the Secretary that such amount has been distributed (within the meaning of subparagraph (B)) to correct such failure, and

(D) such distribution is treated under subsection (h)(2) as made out of the undistributed income for the taxable year for which a tax would (except for this paragraph) have been imposed under this subsection.



(b) Additional taxIn any case in which an initial tax is imposed under subsection (a) on the undistributed income of a private foundation for any taxable year, if any portion of such income remains undistributed at the close of the taxable period, there is hereby imposed a tax equal to 100 percent of the amount remaining undistributed at such time.


(c) Undistributed incomeFor purposes of this section, the term “undistributed income” means, with respect to any private foundation for any taxable year as of any time, the amount by which—(1) the distributable amount for such taxable year, exceeds

(2) the qualifying distributions made before such time out of such distributable amount.


(d) Distributable amountFor purposes of this section, the term “distrib­utable amount” means, with respect to any foundation for any taxable year, an amount equal to—(1) the sum of the minimum investment return plus the amounts described in subsection (f)(2)(C), reduced by

(e) Minimum investment return(1) In generalFor purposes of subsection (d), the minimum investment return for any private foundation for any taxable year is 5 percent of the excess of—(A) the aggregate fair market value of all assets of the foundation other than those which are used (or held for use) directly in carrying out the foundation’s exempt purpose, over

(B) the acquisition indebtedness with respect to such assets (determined under section 514(c)(1) without regard to the taxable year in which the indebtedness was incurred).


(2) Valuation(A) In generalFor purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the fair market value of securities for which market quotations are readily available shall be determined on a monthly basis.

(B) Reductions in value for blockage or similar factorsIn determining the value of any securities under this paragraph, the fair market value of such securities (determined without regard to any reduction in value) shall not be reduced unless, and only to the extent that, the private foundation establishes that as a result of—(i) the size of the block of such securities,

(ii) the fact that the securities held are securities in a closely held corporation, or

(iii) the fact that the sale of such securities would result in a forced or distress sale,


the securities could not be liquidated within a reasonable period of time except at a price less than such fair market value. Any reduction in value allowable under this subparagraph shall not exceed 10 percent of such fair market value.



(f) Adjusted net income(1) DefinedFor purposes of subsection (j), the term “adjusted net income” means the excess (if any) of—(A) the gross income for the taxable year (determined with the income modifications provided by paragraph (2)), over

(B) the sum of the deductions (determined with the deduction modifications provided by paragraph (3)) which would be allowed to a corporation subject to the tax imposed by section 11 for the taxable year.


(2) Income modificationsThe income modifications referred to in paragraph (1)(A) are as follows:(A) section 103 (relating to State and local bonds) shall not apply,

(ii) notwithstanding subparagraph (B), amounts received or accrued from the sale or other disposition of property to the extent that the acquisition of such property was taken into account as a qualifying distribution (within the meaning of subsection (g)(1)(B)) for any taxable year; and

(iii) any amount set aside under subsection (g)(2) to the extent it is determined that such amount is not necessary for the purposes for which it was set aside; and


(D) section 483 (relating to imputed interest) shall not apply in the case of a binding contract made in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970.


(3) Deduction modificationsThe deduction modifications referred to in paragraph (1)(B) are as follows:(A) no deduction shall be allowed other than all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred for the production or collection of gross income or for the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the production of such income and the allowances for depreciation and depletion determined under section 4940(c)(3)(B), and

(4) Transitional ruleFor purposes of paragraph (2)(B), the basis (for purposes of determining gain) of property held by a private foundation on December 31, 1969, and continuously thereafter to the date of its disposition, shall be deemed to be not less than the fair market value of such property on December 31, 1969.



(g) Qualifying distributions defined(1) In generalFor purposes of this section, the term “qualifying distribution” means—(A) any amount (including that portion of reasonable and necessary administrative expenses) paid to accomplish one or more purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B), other than any contribution to (i) an organization controlled (directly or indirectly) by the foundation or one or more disqualified persons (as defined in section 4946) with respect to the foundation, except as provided in paragraph (3), or (ii) a private foundation which is not an operating foundation (as defined in subsection (j)(3)), except as provided in paragraph (3), or

(II) the private foundation in each taxable year beginning after December 31, 1975 (or after the end of the fourth taxable year following the year of its creation, whichever is later), distributes amounts, in cash or its equivalent, equal to not less than the distributable amount determined under subsection (d) (without regard to subsection (i)) for purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B) (including but not limited to payments with respect to set-asides which were treated as qualifying distributions in one or more prior years), and

(III) the private foundation has distributed (including but not limited to payments with respect to set-asides which were treated as qualifying distributions in one or more prior years) during the four taxable years immediately preceding its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1975, or the fifth taxable year following the year of its creation, whichever is later, an aggregate amount, in cash or its equivalent, of not less than the sum of the following: 80 percent of the first preceding taxable year’s distributable amount; 60 percent of the second preceding taxable year’s distributable amount; 40 percent of the third preceding taxable year’s distributable amount; and 20 percent of the fourth preceding taxable year’s distributable amount.



(C) Certain failures to distributeIf, for any taxable year to which clause (ii)(II) of subparagraph (B) applies, the private foundation fails to distribute in cash or its equivalent amounts not less than those required by such clause and—(i) the failure to distribute such amounts was not willful and was due to reasonable cause, and

(ii) the foundation distributes an amount in cash or its equivalent which is not less than the difference between the amounts required to be distributed under clause (ii)(II) of subparagraph (B) and the amounts actually distributed in cash or its equivalent during that taxable year within the correction period (as defined in section 4963(e)),


such distribution in cash or its equivalent shall be treated for the purposes of this subparagraph as made during such year.

(D) Reduction in distribution amountIf, during the taxable years in the adjustment period for which the organization is a private foundation, the foundation distributes amounts in cash or its equivalent which exceed the amount required to be distributed under clause (ii)(II) of subparagraph (B) (including but not limited to payments with respect to set-asides which were treated as qualifying distributions in prior years), then for purposes of this subsection the distribution required under clause (ii)(II) of subparagraph (B) for the taxable year shall be reduced by an amount equal to such excess.


(E) Adjustment periodFor purposes of subparagraph (D), with respect to any taxable year of a private foundation, the taxable years in the adjustment period are the taxable years (not exceeding 5) beginning after December 31, 1975, and immediately preceding the taxable year.

(B) the private foundation making the contribution obtains adequate records or other sufficient evidence from such organization showing that the qualifying distribution described in subparagraph (A) has been made by such organization.


(4) Limitation on distributions by nonoperating private foundations to supporting organizations(A) In generalFor purposes of this section, the term “qualifying distribution” shall not include any amount paid by a private foundation which is not an operating foundation to—(i) any type III supporting organization (as defined in section 4943(f)(5)(A)) which is not a functionally integrated type III supporting organization (as defined in section 4943(f)(5)(B)), and

(ii) any organization which is described in subparagraph (B) or (C) if—(I) a disqualified person of the private foundation directly or indirectly controls such organization or a supported organization (as defined in section 509(f)(3)) of such organization, or

(II) the Secretary determines by regulations that a distribution to such organization otherwise is inappropriate.



(B) Type I and type II supporting organizationsAn organization is described in this subparagraph if the organization meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (C) of section 509(a)(3) and is—(i) operated, supervised, or controlled by one or more organizations described in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 509(a), or

(B) second out of the undistributed income for the taxable year to the extent thereof, and

(C) then out of corpus.


For purposes of this paragraph, distributions shall be taken into account in the order of time in which made.

(2) Correction of deficient distributions for prior taxable years, etc.In the case of any qualifying distribution which (under paragraph (1)) is not treated as made out of the undistributed income of the immediately preceding taxable year, the foundation may elect to treat any portion of such distribution as made out of the undistributed income of a designated prior taxable year or out of corpus. The election shall be made by the foundation at such time and in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe.



(i) Adjustment of distributable amount where distributions during prior years have exceeded income(1) In generalIf, for the taxable years in the adjustment period for which an organization is a private foundation—(A) the aggregate qualifying distributions treated (under subsection (h)) as made out of the undistributed income for such taxable year or as made out of corpus (except to the extent subsection (g)(3) with respect to the recipient private foundation or section 170(b)(1)(F)(ii) applies) during such taxable years, exceed
