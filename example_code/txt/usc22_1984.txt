§ 2764. Guaranties(a) Guaranty against political and credit risks of nonpaymentThe President may guarantee any individual, corporation, partnership, or other juridical entity doing business in the United States (excluding United States Government agencies other than the Federal Financing Bank) against political and credit risks of nonpayment arising out of their financing of credit sales of defense articles, defense services, and design and construction services to friendly countries and international organizations. Fees shall be charged for such guaranties.


(b) Sale of promissory notes of friendly countries and international organizations; guaranty of paymentThe President may sell to any individual, corporation, partnership, or other juridical entity (excluding United States Government agencies other than the Federal Financing Bank) promissory notes issued by friendly countries and international organizations as evidence of their obligations to make repayments to the United States on account of credit sales financed under section 2763 of this title, and may guarantee payment thereof.


(c) Guaranty Reserve Fund; payment of guaranties; guaranty reserve below prescribed amountFunds obligated under this section before December 16, 1980, which constitute a single reserve for the payment of claims under guaranties issued under this section shall remain available for expenditure for the purposes of this section on and after that date. That single reserve may, on and after August 8, 1985, be referred to as the “Guaranty Reserve Fund”. Funds provided for necessary expenses to carry out the provisions of section 2763 of this title and of section 2311 of this title may be used to pay claims on the Guaranty Reserve Fund to the extent that funds in the Guaranty Reserve Fund are inadequate for that purpose. For purposes of any provision in this chapter or any other Act relating to a prohibition or limitation on the availability of funds under this chapter, whenever a guaranty is issued under this section, the principal amount of the loan so guaranteed shall be deemed to be funds made available for use under this chapter. Any guaranties issued hereunder shall be backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.

Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 96–533, § 104(a), substituted provisions making funds obligated before Dec. 16, 1980 available for expenditure after such date for payment of guaranteed claims, requiring the President to report to Congress the reduction of the single reserve below $750,000,000 with recommendation for an appropriations authorization of additional funds and deeming the principal amount of a guaranteed loan to be funds made available for use under this chapter for purposes of any limitation on availability of funds for prior provisions for obligation of available funds in an amount equal to 10 per centum of principal amount of contractual liability related to a guaranty under this section, making such funds a single reserve for payment of guaranteed claims, and providing for transfer of any funds deobligated during any current fiscal year to the general fund of the Treasury.
