(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 503; Oct. 31, 1951, ch. 654, §§ 1(32), 2(9), 3(3), 65 Stat. 702, 707, 708; Pub. L. 97–295, § 2(4), Oct. 12, 1982, 96 Stat. 1301; Pub. L. 98–557, § 15(a)(3)(D), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2865; Pub. L. 107–217, § 3(c)(1), Aug. 21, 2002, 116 Stat. 1298; Pub. L. 111–350, § 5(c)(1), Jan. 4, 2011, 124 Stat. 3847.)

Historical and Revision NotesThis section grants broad general powers concerning policy matters to the Secretary. Many of the powers are contained in existing law but some are enlarged and some additional powers are added as explained following.
Subsection (a) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 95 (Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601). Said section has been divided. The provision authorizing the Secretary to man stations seems more appropriately given to the operational head of the Service, the Commandant, and for that reason is incorporated in section 93(c) of this title.
Subsection (b) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§ 28, 42 (Aug. 16, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, § 11, 44 Stat. 817). These sections were rewritten in order to broaden existing authority in regard to the training of Coast Guard personnel at schools of the other armed forces, thus approaching a practice of war time, and making for economy in the training of Service personnel; such training would be on a basis mutually satisfactory to the Secretaries involved.
Subsection (c) is based on R.S. 4242 and on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§ 29, 93, 94, 98a (R.S. 4245, 4249; May 4, 1882, ch. 117, § 2, 22 Stat. 56; Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601; June 6, 1940, ch. 257, § 4, 54 Stat. 247; Aug. 6, 1947, ch. 502, 61 Stat. 786). This subsection broadens existing law in that it provides general legislative authority for the construction and disposal of shore establishments of all types including aviation stations.
Subsection (d) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§ 55, 57, 69, 109, and in part on title 31, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§ 487, 720, (R.S. 2748, 3618, 3692; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, § 3, 20 Stat. 163; Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601). This subsection broadens existing law in that it provides general legislative authority for the design, construction, acquisition by other means, and disposal of vessels.
Subsection (e) is new. It is derived from title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 31b (June 6, 1941, ch. 177, 55 Stat. 247 [which was originally repealed by act June 30, 1949, ch. 288, title VI, § 602(a)(28), 63 Stat. 399, renumbered Sept. 5, 1950, ch. 849, § 6(a), (b), 64 Stat. 583]) which provides for the exchange of vehicles, planes, and engines; similar authority in relation to vessels, is granted to the Secretary by this subsection and should prove advantageous to the Government.
Subsection (f) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 96 and on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§ 729, 730, 731 (Mar. 3, 1875, ch. 130, § 1, 18 Stat. 372; Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 299, 35 Stat. 972; June 17, 1910, ch. 301, § 9, 36 Stat. 538; Mar. 4, 1913, ch. 168, 37 Stat. 1018). This subsection broadens the power of the Secretary to receive as a gift or purchase sites for stations, to include the acquisition of land by any means provided it is for the purpose of executing duties and functions of the Coast Guard.
Subsection (g) is based in part on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 732 (Aug. 28, 1916, ch. 414, § 2, 39 Stat. 538; July 11, 1941, ch. 290, § 1, 55 Stat. 584) and grants authority to the Secretary to exchange interests in land as payment or part payment for other interests in land for the purpose of executing the duties and functions of the Coast Guard; this authority, on the basis of past experience, will prove advantageous to the Government.
Subsection (h) is new and merely insures that the Secretary may exercise any of the powers granted to the Commandant in this title.
Subsection (i) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§ 51, 131 (R.S. 2756, 2758) and insures that the Secretary may do anything necessary to carry out the purposes of this title.

“(a) In General.—Whenever the transfer of ownership of a Coast Guard vessel or aircraft to an eligible entity for use for educational, cultural, historical, charitable, recreational, or other public purposes is authorized by law or declared excess by the Commandant, the Coast Guard shall transfer the vessel or aircraft to the General Services Administration for conveyance to the eligible entity.

“(b) Conditions of Conveyance.—The General Services Administration may not convey a vessel or aircraft to an eligible entity as authorized by law unless the eligible entity agrees—“(1) to provide the documentation needed by the General Services Administration to process a request for aircraft or vessels under section 102.37.225 of title 41, Code of Federal Regulations;

Great Lakes LighthousesPub. L. 107–295, title III, § 345, Nov. 25, 2002, 116 Stat. 2106, provided that:
“(a) Findings.—The Congress finds the following:“(1) The Great Lakes are home to more than 400 lighthouses. One hundred and twenty of these maritime landmarks are in the State of Michigan.

“(2) Lighthouses are an important part of Great Lakes culture and stand as a testament to the importance of shipping in the region’s political, economic, and social history.

“(3) Advances in navigation technology have made many Great Lakes lighthouses obsolete. In Michigan alone, approximately 70 lighthouses will be designated as excess property of the Federal Government and will be transferred to the General Services Administration for disposal.

“(4) Unfortunately, the Federal property disposal process is confusing, complicated, and not well-suited to disposal of historic lighthouses or to facilitate transfers to nonprofit organizations. This is especially troubling because, in many cases, local nonprofit historical organizations have dedicated tremendous resources to preserving and maintaining Great Lakes lighthouses.

“(5) If Great Lakes lighthouses disappear, the public will be unaware of an important chapter in Great Lakes history.

“(6) The National Trust for Historic Preservation has placed Michigan lighthouses on their list of Most Endangered Historic Places.


“(b) Assistance for Great Lakes Lighthouse Preservation Efforts.—The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, may—“(1) continue to offer advice and technical assistance to organizations in the Great Lakes region that are dedicated to lighthouse stewardship; and

“(2) promptly release information regarding the timing of designations of Coast Guard lighthouses on the Great Lakes as excess to the needs of the Coast Guard, to enable those organizations to mobilize and be prepared to take appropriate action with respect to the disposal of those properties.”

“(a) The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating may authorize a person providing commercial VHF communications services to place commercial VHF communications equipment on real property under the administrative control of the Coast Guard (including towers) subject to any terms agreed to by the parties. The Secretary and that commercial VHF communications service provider also may enter into an agreement providing for VHF communications services to the Coast Guard (including digital selective calling and radio direction finding services) at a discounted rate or price based on providing such access to real property under the administrative control of the Coast Guard.

“(b) Commercial VHF communication equipment placed on real property under the administrative control of the Coast Guard under this section shall not interfere in any manner with any current or future Coast Guard communication equipment.

“(c) Nothing in this section shall affect the rights or obligations of the United States under section 704(c) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 [Pub. L. 104–104] (47 U.S.C. 332 note) with respect to the availability of property or under section 359(d) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 357(d)) with respect to charges for transmission of distress messages.”

“(a) In General.—The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating (hereinafter in this section referred to as the ‘Secretary’) may carry out a pilot program to establish and maintain a junior reserve officers training program in cooperation with the Dade County Public School System of Dade County, Florida, as part of the Maritime and Science Technology Academy established by that school system (hereinafter in this section referred to as the ‘Academy’).

“(b) Program Requirements.—A pilot program carried out by the Secretary under this section—“(1) shall be known as the ‘Claude Pepper Junior Reserve Officers Training Program’, and
