“SEC. 4482. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.“(a) Findings.—The Congress finds that—“(1) the men and women serving in our Nation’s Armed Forces are of the highest caliber—intelligent, dedicated, and disciplined—and hundreds of thousands of these service members will be separating from the Armed Forces due to the drawdown in military personnel;

“(2) these men and women will be entering the civilian workforce during a time of economic instability and uncertainty;

“(3) many of these service personnel specialized in critical skills such as combat arms which will not transfer to the civilian workforce;

“(4) as part of the Nation’s obligation to these service members, the Secretary of Defense has a unique responsibility and obligation to provide them with the tools they need to be reassimilated into the civilian community and continue to be outstanding, productive citizens;

“(5) the rapid placement of separated military personnel in civilian employment and training opportunities will significantly reduce the Department of Defense’s costs relative to unemployment compensation for ex-service members;

“(6) military personnel are a national resource whose skills and abilities must be absorbed by and integrated into the civilian workforce; and

“(7) providing such training will reduce the total cost of the drawdown and is important to the national defense function of the Department of Defense.


“(b) Purpose.—The purpose of this subtitle is to provide additional means by which the Secretary of Defense can manage the drawdown of the Armed Forces and to provide additional forms of assistance to members of the Armed Forces who are forced or induced to leave military service by reason of the drawdown of the Armed Forces, thereby facilitating the Secretary’s ability to achieve end strength reductions caused by the drawdown.
