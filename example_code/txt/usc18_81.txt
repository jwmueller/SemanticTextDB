(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 694, § 210, formerly § 214; renumbered § 210, Pub. L. 87–849, § 1(b), Oct. 23, 1962, 76 Stat. 1125; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(H), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on Title 18, U. S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 149 and 151 (Dec. 11, 1926, c. 3, §§ 1, 3, 44 Stat. 918).
Changes of style and substance were made in this section.
Term “or place” was inserted after words “appointive office” in order to give broader scope to the section and also to follow the phraseology used in similar provisions of section 202 of Title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., now section 216 [repealed] of this title. (See 46 Corpus Juris 924, where it is explained that the work “places” is used in a less technical sense than the word “offices”.)
The punishment provision, added at the end of this section and section 215 [now section 211] of this title to secure uniformity of style throughout this chapter, was originally enacted as a separate section, incorporating the other two by reference. 80th Congress House Report No. 304.

Prior ProvisionsA prior section 210, act June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 693, related to acceptance of a bribe by a witness, prior to the general amendment of this chapter by Pub. L. 87–849 and is substantially covered in revised section 201.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $1,000”.
