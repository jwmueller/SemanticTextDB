“Where—“(1) one or more persons are entitled (without the application of sections 202(j)(1) and 223(b) of the Social Security Act) [42 U.S.C. 402(j)(1), 423(b)] to monthly benefits under section 202 or 223 of such Act for December 1972 on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of an insured individual, and

“(2) one or more persons (not included in paragraph (1)) are entitled to monthly benefits under such section 202 or 223 [42 U.S.C. 402, 423] for January 1973 solely by reason of the amendments made by this section on the basis of such wages and self-employment income, and

“(3) the total of benefits to which all persons are entitled under such sections 202 and 223 on the basis of such wages and self-employment income for January 1973 is reduced by reason of section 203(a) of such Act [42 U.S.C. 403(a)] as amended by this Act, or would, but for the penultimate sentence of such section 203(a), be so reduced),


then the amount of the benefit to which each person referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection is entitled for months after December 1972 shall be adjusted, after the application of such section 203(a) [42 U.S.C. 403(a)], to an amount no less than the amount it would have been if the person or persons referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection were not entitled to a benefit referred to in such paragraph (2).”
