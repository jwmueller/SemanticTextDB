(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 920; Pub. L. 100–702, title X, § 1003(a)(3), Nov. 19, 1988, 102 Stat. 4665.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 222a (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 118a, as added June 17, 1930, ch. 509, 46 Stat. 774).
Provision of section 222a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to compensation of law clerks is incorporated in section 604 of this title. (See reviser’s note under such section.)
Words “with the approval of the Attorney General,” were omitted to confer on circuit judges the same authority given Supreme Court justices under section 675 of this title.
The provision for appointment of secretaries is new. Existing law fixes compensation of secretaries but makes no provision for their appointment. (See section 604 of this title and reviser’s note thereunder.)
Changes were made in phraseology.
