§ 1961. Authority for higher interest rates for amounts payable to beneficiaries
Notwithstanding section 1944(b) of this title, if the beneficiary of an insurance policy issued under the provisions of this subchapter receives the proceeds of such policy under a settlement option under which such proceeds are paid in equal monthly installments over a limited period of months, the interest that may be added to each such installment may be at a rate that is higher than the interest rate prescribed in such section. The Secretary may from time to time establish a higher interest rate under the preceding sentence only in accordance with a determination that such higher rate is administratively and actuarially sound. Any such higher interest rate shall be paid on the unpaid balance of such monthly installments.
