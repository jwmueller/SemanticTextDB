Prior ProvisionsA prior section 420 of Pub. L. 90–247 was renumbered section 426, and is classified to section 1228 of this title.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–382, § 231, amended section generally. Prior to amendment, section read as follows: “To the end of affording the responsible State, local, and Federal officers concerned adequate notice of available Federal financial assistance for education, appropriations for grants, contracts, or other payments under any applicable program are authorized to be included in the appropriation Act for the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which they are available for obligation. In order to effect a transition to this method of timing appropriation action, the preceding sentence shall apply notwithstanding that its initial application under such program will result in the enactment in the same year (whether in the same appropriation Act or otherwise) of two separate appropriations, one for the then current fiscal year and one for the succeeding fiscal year.”
1970—Pub. L. 91–230 substituted “applicable program” and “under such program” for “Act referred to in section 1221 of this title” and “under any such Act”, respectively.
