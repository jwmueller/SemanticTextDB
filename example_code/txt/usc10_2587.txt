The word “officers” is substituted for the word “officer” since the cited subsection of the Act of May 5, 1950, was intended to reenact the substance of Article 21 of the Articles for the Government of the Navy (R.S. 1624; 34 U.S.C. 1200), in which the word “officers” was used. The words “regularly” and “by competent authority” are omitted as surplusage.
