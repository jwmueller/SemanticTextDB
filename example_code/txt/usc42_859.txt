(ii) repayable less frequently than monthly and in default for at least 180 days;


(C) the term “grace period” means the period of nine months beginning on the date on which the borrower ceases to pursue a full-time or half-time course of study at a school of nursing; and

(D) the term “matured loans” means the total principal amount of all loans made by a school of nursing under this part minus the total principal amount of loans made by such school to students who are—(i) enrolled in a full-time or half-time course of study at such school; or
