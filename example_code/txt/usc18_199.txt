Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 147 (Dec. 11, 1926, ch. 2, § 2, 44 Stat. 918).
References to persons causing, procuring, aiding or assisting were omitted as unnecessary as such persons are made principals by section 2 of this title.
Words “upon conviction” in last paragraph were omitted as surplusage since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.
Minor changes in phraseology were also made.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000” in last par.
