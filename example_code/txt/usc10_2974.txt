766834 U.S.C. 1151.R.S. 4630; R.S. 4641.


R.S. 4630 provided that in some circumstances the captors were to receive the net proceeds of prize property and in other circumstances they were to receive half and the United States was to receive the other half. The Act of March 3, 1899, ch. 413, § 13, 30 Stat. 1007, repealed “all provisions of law authorizing the distribution among captors of the whole or any portion of the proceeds of vessels, or any property hereafter captured, condemned as prize”. Thus the only part of R.S. 4630 that remains in effect, as is indicated in 34 U.S.C. 1151, is that part which provides that proceeds shall be decreed to the United States. The section is so worded. R.S. 4641 stated how proceeds decreed to captors should be divided among them. These provisions were eliminated by the Act of March 3, 1899, supra. All that remains of R.S. 4641, as is indicated in 34 U.S.C. 1151, is the provision that proceeds decreed to the United States shall be paid into the Treasury, and the section is worded accordingly.
