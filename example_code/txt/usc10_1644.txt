§ 2421. Plantations and farms: operation, maintenance, and improvement(a) Appropriations for the subsistence of members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps are available for expenditures necessary in the operation, maintenance, and improvement of any plantation or farm, outside the United States and under the jurisdiction of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps, as the case may be, for furnishing fresh fruits and vegetables to the armed forces. However, no land may be acquired under this subsection.

(b) Fruits and vegetables produced under subsection (a) that are over the amount furnished or sold to the armed forces or to civilians serving with the armed forces may be sold only outside the United States.

(c) Of the persons employed by the United States under subsection (a), only nationals of the United States are entitled to the benefits provided by laws relating to the employment, work, compensation, or other benefits of civilian employees of the United States.

(d) A plantation or farm covered by subsection (a) shall be operated, maintained, and improved by a private contractor or lessee, so far as practicable. Before using members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps, as the case may be, the Secretary concerned must make a reasonable effort to make a contract or lease with a person in civil life for his services for that operation, maintenance, or improvement, on terms advantageous to the United States. A determination by the Secretary as to the reasonableness of effort to make a contract or lease, and as to the advantageous nature of its terms, is final.
