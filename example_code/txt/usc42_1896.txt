L. 105–33] referred to as the ‘Secretary’) shall establish a demonstration project (in this subchapter referred to as the ‘project’) under which payments to Medicare+Choice organizations in medicare payment areas in which the project is being conducted are determined in accordance with a competitive pricing methodology established under this subchapter.

“(2) Delay in implementation.—The Secretary shall not implement the project until January 1, 2002, or, if later, 6 months after the date the Competitive Pricing Advisory Committee has submitted to Congress a report on each of the following topics:“(A) Incorporation of original medicare fee-for-service program into project.—What changes would be required in the project to feasibly incorporate the original medicare fee-for-service program into the project in the areas in which the project is operational.

“(B) Quality activities.—The nature and extent of the quality reporting and monitoring activities that should be required of plans participating in the project, the estimated costs that plans will incur as a result of these requirements, and the current ability of the Health Care Financing Administration to collect and report comparable data, sufficient to support comparable quality reporting and monitoring activities with respect to beneficiaries enrolled in the original medicare fee-for-service program generally.

“(C) Rural project.—The current viability of initiating a project site in a rural area, given the site specific budget neutrality requirements of the project under subsection (g), and insofar as the Committee decides that the addition of such a site is not viable, recommendations on how the project might best be changed so that such a site is viable.

“(D) Benefit structure.—The nature and extent of the benefit structure that should be required of plans participating in the project, the rationale for such benefit structure, the potential implications that any benefit standardization requirement may have on the number of plan choices available to a beneficiary in an area designated under the project, the potential implications of requiring participating plans to offer variations on any standardized benefit package the committee might recommend, such that a beneficiary could elect to pay a higher percentage of out-of-pocket costs in exchange for a lower premium (or premium rebate as the case may be), and the potential implications of expanding the project (in conjunction with the potential inclusion of the original medicare fee-for-service program) to require medicare supplemental insurance plans operating in an area designated under the project to offer a coordinated and comparable standardized benefit package.


“(3) Conforming deadlines.—Any dates specified in the succeeding provisions of this section shall be delayed (as specified by the Secretary) in a manner consistent with the delay effected under paragraph (2).


“(b) Designation of 7 Medicare Payment Areas Covered by Project.—“(1) In general.—The Secretary shall designate, in accordance with the recommendations of the Competitive Pricing Advisory Committee under paragraphs (2) and (3), medicare payment areas as areas in which the project under this subchapter will be conducted. In this section, the term ‘Competitive Pricing Advisory Committee’ means the Competitive Pricing Advisory Committee established under section 4012(a).

“(2) Initial designation of 4 areas.—“(A) In general.—The Competitive Pricing Advisory Committee shall recommend to the Secretary, consistent with subparagraph (B), the designation of 4 specific areas as medicare payment areas to be included in the project.

“(c) Project Implementation.—“(1) In general.—Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary shall for each medicare payment area designated under subsection (b)—“(A) in accordance with the recommendations of the Competitive Pricing Advisory Committee—“(i) establish the benefit design among plans offered in such area,

“(ii) structure the method for selecting plans offered in such area; and

“(iii) establish beneficiary premiums for plans offered in such area in a manner such that a beneficiary who enrolls in an offered plan the per capita bid for which is less than the standard per capita government contribution (as established by the competitive pricing methodology established for such area) may, at the plan’s election, be offered a rebate of some or all of the medicare part B premium that such individual must otherwise pay in order to participate in a Medicare+Choice plan under the Medicare+Choice program; and


“(B) in consultation with such Committee—“(i) establish methods for setting the price to be paid to plans, including, if the Secretaries determines appropriate, the rewarding and penalizing of Medicare+Choice plans in the area on the basis of the attainment of, or failure to attain, applicable quality standards, and

“(ii) provide for the collection of plan information (including information concerning quality and access to care), the dissemination of information, and the methods of evaluating the results of the project.



“(2) Consultation.—The Secretary shall take into account the recommendations of the area advisory committee established in section 4012(b), in implementing a project design for any area, except that no modifications may be made in the project design without consultation with the Competitive Pricing Advisory Committee. In no case may the Secretary change the designation of an area based on recommendations of any area advisory committee.


“(d) Monitoring and Report.—“(1) Monitoring impact.—Taking into consideration the recommendations of the Competitive Pricing Advisory Committee and the area advisory committees, the Secretary shall closely monitor and measure the impact of the project in the different areas on the price and quality of, and access to, medicare covered services, choice of health plans, changes in enrollment, and other relevant factors.

“(2) Report.—Not later than December 31, 2002, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on the progress under the project under this subchapter, including a comparison of the matters monitored under paragraph (1) among the different designated areas. The report may include any legislative recommendations for extending the project to the entire medicare population.


“(e) Waiver Authority.—The Secretary of Health and Human Services may waive such requirements of title XVIII of the Social Security Act [this subchapter] (as amended by this Act) as may be necessary for the purposes of carrying out the project.

“(f) Relationship to Other Authority.—Except pursuant to this subchapter, the Secretary of Health and Human Services may not conduct or continue any medicare demonstration project relating to payment of health maintenance organizations, Medicare+Choice organizations, or similar prepaid managed care entities on the basis of a competitive bidding process or pricing system described in subsection (a).

“(g) No Additional Costs to Medicare Program.—The aggregate payments to Medicare+Choice organizations under the project for any designated area for a fiscal year may not exceed the aggregate payments to such organizations that would have been made under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.), as amended by section 4001 [enacting this part and redesignating former part C of this subchapter as part D], if the project had not been conducted.
