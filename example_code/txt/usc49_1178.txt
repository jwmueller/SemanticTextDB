The words “interested person” are substituted for “party in interest” for consistency. The words “may bring a civil action” are substituted for “may apply” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code and rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.). The text of 49 App.:1487(a) (words after semicolon related to party in interest) is omitted as surplus because of 28:1651 and rule 81(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
