In subsection (a), the words “bring a civil action . . . in a district court of the United States” are substituted for “petition a district court of the United States” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. See rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.). The words “of competent jurisdiction” are omitted as unnecessary.
In subsection (b), the word “pending” before “freight” is added for consistency in the chapter. The words “to carry out this chapter” are substituted for “to carry out the provisions of section 183 of this Appendix” because of the reorganization of the source provisions.
