§ 5953. Term of concessions contracts
A concessions contract entered into pursuant to this subchapter shall generally be awarded for a term of 10 years or less. However, the Secretary may award a contract for a term of up to 20 years if the Secretary determines that the contract terms and conditions, including the required construction of capital improvements, warrant a longer term.
