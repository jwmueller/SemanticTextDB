“Where—“(1) two or more persons were entitled (without the application of subsection (j)(1) of section 202 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 402(j)(1)]) to monthly benefits under such section 202 for the last month beginning before the effective date of this title [see Effective Date of 1961 Amendment note set out above] on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of a deceased individual, and one or more of such persons is entitled to a monthly insurance benefit under subsection (e), (f), or (h) of such section 202 for such last month; and

“(2) no person, other than the persons referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection, is entitled to benefits under such section 202 on the basis of such individual’s wages and self-employment income for a subsequent month or for any month after such last month and before such subsequent month; and

“(3) the total of the benefits to which all persons are entitled under such section 202 on the basis of such individual’s wages and self-employment income for such subsequent month is reduced by reason of the application of section 203(a) of such Act [42 U.S.C. 403(a)],


then the amount of the benefit to which each such person referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection is entitled for such subsequent month shall be determined without regard to this Act if, after the application of this Act, such benefit for such month is less than the amount of such benefit for such last month. The preceding provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any monthly benefit of any person for any month beginning after the effective date of this title [see Effective Date note of 1961 Amendment note set out above] unless paragraph (3) also applies to such benefit for the month beginning on such effective date (or would so apply but for the next to the last sentence of section 203(a) of the Social Security Act).”
