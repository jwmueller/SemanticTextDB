(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 731; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(K), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 641e of title 50, App. U.S.C., 1940 ed., War and National Defense (Mar. 27, 1942, 3 p. m., E. W. T., c. 199, Title XI, § 1106, 56 Stat. 184).
This section was taken from the Second War Powers Act of 1942, which was temporary legislation. However, the subject matter was so independent of the war effort as to warrant its inclusion in this title as a permanent provision.
Words “shall be guilty of a felony” were omitted. See Reviser’s Note under section 550 of this title.
Words “and upon conviction thereof” were omitted as unnecessary since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000”.
