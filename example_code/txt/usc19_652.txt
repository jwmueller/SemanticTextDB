“SEC. 403. APPLICATION OF CERTAIN OTHER TRADE LAW PROVISIONS.“(a) Suspension of Duty-Free Treatment.—The President may by proclamation suspend the reduction or elimination of any duty provided under any trade agreement provision entered into with Israel under the authority of section 102(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2112(b)(1)] with respect to any article and may proclaim a duty rate for such article if such action is proclaimed under section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2253] or section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 [19 U.S.C. 1862].

“(b) ITC Reports.—In any report by the United States International Trade Commission (hereinafter referred to in this title [this note] as the ‘Commission’) to the President under section 202(f) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2252(f)] regarding any article for which a reduction or elimination of any duty is provided under a trade agreement entered into with Israel under section 102(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2112(b)(1)], the Commission shall state whether and to what extent its findings and recommendations apply to such an article when imported from Israel.

“(c) For purposes of section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2253], the suspension of the reduction or elimination of a duty under subsection (a) shall be treated as an increase in duty.

“(d) No proclamation which provides solely for a suspension referred to in subsection (a) with respect to any article shall be made under section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2253], unless the Commission, in addition to making an affirmative determination with respect to such article under section 202(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2252(b)], determines in the course of its investigation under that section that the serious injury (or threat thereof) substantially caused by imports to the domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive article results from the reduction or elimination of any duty provided under any trade agreement provision entered into with Israel under section 102(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2112(b)(1)].

“(e)(1) Any proclamation issued under section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2253] that is in effect when an agreement with Israel is entered into under section 102(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2112(b)(1)] shall remain in effect until modified or terminated.

“(2) If any article is subject to import relief at the time an agreement is entered into with Israel under section 102(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2112(b)(1)], the President may reduce or terminate the application of such import relief to the importation of such article before the otherwise scheduled date on which such reduction or termination would occur pursuant to the criteria and procedures of sections 203 and 204 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2253, 2254].
