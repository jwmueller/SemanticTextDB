The words “Except for public moneys deposited under section 2041 of this title . . . public moneys” are substituted for “All fees and other collections other than moneys referred to in subsection (a) of this section” for consistency and because 31:725v(a) is superseded by 28:2041 and is not part of the revised title contained in section 1 of the bill. The word “Treasury” is substituted for “Treasurer of the United States” because of section 1 of Reorganization Plan No. 26 of 1950 (eff. July 31, 1950, 64 Stat. 1280), restated as section 321 of the revised title contained in section 1 of the bill. The text of 31:725v(b)(last sentence) is omitted as obsolete.
