Determination Regarding Acceptance and Application of Certain International Trade Agreements1. Pursuant to section 102 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2112(b)), I, through my duly empowered representative, on April 12, 1979, entered into the international agreements negotiated in the Tokyo Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations. These agreements were:
(i) Agreement on Interpretation and Application of Articles VI, XVI and XXIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade;
(ii) Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade;
 (iii) Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade;
(iv) Agreement on Government Procurement;
(v) Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade;
(vi) Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures;
(vii) Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft;
(viii) International Dairy Arrangement; and
(ix) Arrangement Regarding Bovine Meat.
These agreements are collectively referred to herein as the “MTN agreements”.
2. In accordance with sections 102 and 151 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2112 and 2191), the MTN agreements were submitted to Congress for its approval. Section 2 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 147) [this section] approves the MTN agreements and authorizes the President to accept each of the MTN agreements provided that the President determines that all, or all but one, of the major industrial countries (as defined in section 126(d) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2136(d)) is also accepting the agreement. If the President determines that only one major industrial country is not accepting an agreement, the President may nevertheless accept such an agreement if he determines that the acceptance of that agreement by that country is not essential to the effective operation of the agreement, and if:
(A) that country is not a major factor in trade in the products covered by that agreement;
(B) the President has authority to deny the benefits of the agreement to that country and has taken steps to deny the benefits of the agreement to that country; or
(C) a significant portion of United States trade would benefit from the agreement, notwithstanding such nonacceptance, and the President determines and reports to the Congress that it is in the national interest of the United States to accept the agreement.
3. Section 2 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 [this section] also provides that no agreement accepted by the President shall apply between the United States and any other country unless the President determines that such country:
(A) has accepted the obligations of the agreement with respect to the United States, and
(B) should not otherwise be denied the benefits of the agreement with respect to the United States because such country has not accorded adequate benefits, including substantially equal competitive opportunities for the commerce of the United States to the extent required under section 126(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2136(c)), to the United States.
4. Section 701 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended effective January 1, 1980 (93 Stat. 151) [19 U.S.C. 1671], provides that the President must determine that certain conditions must be met before a country can be considered a “country under the Agreement” and, therefore, entitled to the injury determination provided for in section 703(a) and 705(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (93 Stat. 152 and 159) [19 U.S.C. 1671b(a) and 1671d(b)].
5. Section 601(a) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 267) authorizes the President to proclaim certain modifications in the Tariff Schedules of the United States if the President determines that the conditions under section 2(b) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 147) [subsec. (b) of this section] on acceptance of the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft have been fulfilled.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me as President, and in conformity with the provisions of sections 2 [this section] and 601(a) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 147 and 267), herein referred to as “the Act”, section 701 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended effective January 1, 1980 (93 Stat. 151) [19 U.S.C. 1671], and section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code do hereby
