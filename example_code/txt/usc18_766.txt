(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 799; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(K), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 96 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 44, 35 Stat. 1097; Mar. 4, 1917, ch. 180, 39 Stat. 1194; May 22, 1917, ch. 20, § 19, 40 Stat. 89).
Jurisdiction and venue provisions were omitted as unnecessary and inconsistent with Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure providing for prosecution where the offense is committed, and section 3238 of this title providing that trial of offenses committed outside any district shall be in the district where the offender is found, or into which he is first brought.
Words “on conviction thereof” were omitted as surplusage as punishment cannot be imposed until conviction is had.
Minor changes were made in phraseology.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000” in last par.
