Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 600c, 608 (R.S. §§ 236, 823, 848, 855; June 10, 1921, ch. 18, § 305, 42 Stat. 24; Apr. 26, 1926, ch. 183, § 3, 44 Stat. 324; May 17, 1932, ch. 190, 47 Stat. 158; June 25, 1936, ch. 804, 49 Stat. 1921; Oct. 13, 1941, ch. 431, § 2, 55 Stat. 736; Dec. 24, 1942, ch. 825, § 1, 56 Stat. 1088).
Section consolidates parts of sections 600c and 608 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to payment of witnesses. Other provisions of such sections are incorporated in sections 1821 and 1871 of this title.
Provisions in sections 600c and 608 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for payment or certification on order of court were omitted as unnecessary and inappropriate on recommendation of the Judicial Conference Committee on Revision of the Judicial Code.
Words in section 608 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., “to which they appear to be entitled on the certificate of attendance” following the words “all fees” and the concluding phrase “which sum shall be allowed the marshal in the General Accounting Office in his accounts were omitted as unnecessary.”
The second paragraph is new. It conforms to Rule 45(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure but is inconsistent with Rule 17(d) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and supersedes that rule as to Federal criminal cases. The Department of Justice suggests that Rule 17(d) is unworkable. To attempt compliance each deputy marshal serving process must carry, on the average, $500 in cash on trips to serve process.
The marshal must advance the money from his personal funds. The Comptroller General has not been able to set up any procedure to make it feasible to advance fees to Government witnesses.
If a witness is served but fails or refuses to appear, the marshal is out of pocket the money advanced and has no recourse. In the exceptional cases of real necessity, the marshal supplies transportation to an indigent witness under established regulations which protect the disbursement.
Changes were made in phraseology.
