“Sec. 5. (a) The amendments made by section 401 of the Civil Service Retirement Act Amendments of 1956 (70 Stat. 743–760; 5 U.S.C. 2251–2267) [amending provisions covered by this subchapter] may apply at the option of any employee who, prior to July 31, 1956, was separated from the service under the automatic separation provisions of the Civil Service Retirement Act [this subchapter] but whose separation would not have taken effect until after July 30, 1965, if he had been permitted to remain in the service until the expiration of any accumulated or current accrued annual leave to his credit at the time of his separation from the service. Such option shall be exercised by a writing received in the Civil Service Commission before January 1, 1959.

“(b) No increase in annuity provided by this Act or any prior provision of law shall apply in the case of any retired employee who exercises the option permitted by subsection (a) of this section.”
