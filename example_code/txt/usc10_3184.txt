The word “commissioned” is inserted, since the retirement of warrant officers for length of service is covered by section 1293 of this title. The word “regular” is inserted, since 10:943 is applicable historically only to officers of a regular component. The words “and placed on the retired list” are omitted as surplusage. The words “computed under section 8926 of this title” are inserted for clarity.
