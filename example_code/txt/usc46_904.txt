In subsection (c), the words “civil action” are substituted for “suit”, the words “must be brought within 2 years after” are substituted for “shall not be maintainable if brought later than two years from”, and the word “seize” is substituted for “arresting”, for consistency in the revised title. The words “of the plaintiff’s residence or principal place of business” are substituted for “in which the libelant resides or has his principal place of business” for consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsectoin [sic] (d), the reference to section 2304 of title 46 is omitted because of the amendment to section 2304 in section 14(8) of the bill.
