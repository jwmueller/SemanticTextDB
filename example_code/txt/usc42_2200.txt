Rural Housing Loan Guarantees; Findings and PurposePub. L. 101–625, title VII, § 706(a), Nov. 28, 1990, 104 Stat. 4284, provided that:
“(1) Findings.—The Congress finds that—“(A) the Federal Government should encourage support for homeownership through nonsubsidized mortgage loans guaranteed by the Secretary of Agriculture for the purchase of modest homes located in rural areas and small communities of the country that are not adequately served by private conventional, federally insured, or guaranteed mortgage credit providers; and

“(B) many rural areas contain disproportionate amounts of substandard housing in need of repair, but lack the necessary funding and support to modernize such housing through preservation.


“(2) Purpose.—The purpose of this section [amending this section and section 1701x of Title 12, Banks and Banking, and enacting provisions set out above] is to expand homeownership opportunities to low- and moderate-income residents of rural areas of the country through the establishment of guaranteed rural housing loans to be made available in rural locations where there is an insufficient availability of mortgage financing from other sources.”
