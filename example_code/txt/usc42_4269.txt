§ 4853. Worker protection
Not later than 180 days after October 28, 1992, the Secretary of Labor shall issue an interim final regulation regulating occupational exposure to lead in the construction industry. Such interim final regulation shall provide employment and places of employment to employees which are as safe and healthful as those which would prevail under the Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines published at Federal Register 55, page 38973 (September 28, 1990) (Revised Chapter 8). Such interim final regulations shall take effect upon issuance (except that such regulations may include a reasonable delay in the effective date), shall have the legal effect of an Occupational Safety and Health Standard, and shall apply until a final standard becomes effective under section 655 of title 29.
