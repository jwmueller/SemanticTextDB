(V) the last day of a period determined by the Secretary to be approved for enrollment after the termination of a waiver issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section,

(3) Agreements under section 2311(A) Issuance by cooperating StatesAn agreement under section 2311 of this title shall authorize a cooperating State to issue waivers as described in paragraph (1).
