1982—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 97–248 substituted provision that a distribution shall be treated as in complete liquidation if the distribution is one of a series in redemption of all the stock pursuant to a plan for provision that a distribution was to be treated as in partial liquidation if the distribution was one of a series in redemption of all the stock pursuant to a plan, or the distribution was not essentially equivalent to a dividend, was in redemption of part of the stock pursuant to a plan, and occurred within the taxable year or the next taxable year of the plan being adopted, including but not limited to a distribution which met the requirements of former subsec. (b) of this section, and that for the purposes of sections 562(b) and 6043 of this title, a partial liquidation included a redemption of stock to which section 302 of this title applied.
Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 97–248 added subsec. (b) and struck out former subsec. (b) which provided that a distribution was to be treated as in partial liquidation of a corporation if the distribution was attributable to the cessation of a business which had been carried on for the previous 5-year period and had not been acquired by the corporation in a transaction involving recognition of gain or loss during that time, and if the distributing corporation was actively involved in a trade or business immediately after the distribution under the terms described above for the business being liquidated, and that compliance with the above requirements would be determined without regard to whether or not the distribution was pro rata with respect to all the shareholders of the corporation.
Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 97–248 struck out subsec. (c) which provided that the fact that, with respect to a shareholder, a distribution qualified under section 302(a) by reason of section 302(b) would not be taken into account in determining whether the distribution, with respect to such shareholder, was also a distribution in partial liquidation of the corporation.
