Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 64 (R.S. 2764; Aug. 5, 1935, ch. 438, title III, § 308, 49 Stat. 528).
Aircraft are included within the provisions of this section.
The Secretary rather than the President is given the authority to design ensigns and pennants.
Unauthorized display of such insignia is made illegal anywhere rather than only “within the jurisdiction of the United States”.
The language is broadened to include “any person violating this section”; existing law applies to masters of offending vessels only. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

Amendments2010—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 111–281 substituted “Vessels and aircraft authorized by the Secretary” for “Coast Guard vessels and aircraft”.
