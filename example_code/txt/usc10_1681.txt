(E) examines the cost of performance of the function by Department of Defense civilian employees and the cost of performance of the function by one or more contractors to demonstrate whether converting to performance by a contractor will result in savings to the Government over the life of the contract, including—(i) the estimated cost to the Government (based on offers received) for performance of the function by a contractor;

(ii) the estimated cost to the Government for performance of the function by Department of Defense civilian employees; and

(iii) an estimate of all other costs and expenditures that the Government would incur because of the award of such a contract;

(ii) $10,000,000;


(G) requires that the contractor shall not receive an advantage for a proposal that would reduce costs for the Department of Defense by—(i) not making an employer-sponsored health insurance plan (or payment that could be used in lieu of such a plan), health savings account, or medical savings account available to the workers who are to be employed to perform the function under the contract;

(ii) offering to such workers an employer-sponsored health benefits plan that requires the employer to contribute less towards the premium or subscription share than the amount that is paid by the Department of Defense for health benefits for civilian employees of the Department under chapter 89 of title 5; or

(iii) offering to such workers a retirement benefit that, in any year, costs less than the annual retirement cost factor applicable to civilian employees of the Department of Defense under chapter 84 of title 5; and
