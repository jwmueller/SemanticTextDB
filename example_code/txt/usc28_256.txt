The word “spent” is substituted for “expended”. The words “certify the amount spent that he considers” are substituted for “make a certificate of the amount of any such expenditure as he may think it”. The words “his certification is a sufficient voucher” are substituted for “and every such certificate shall be deemed a sufficient voucher”.
