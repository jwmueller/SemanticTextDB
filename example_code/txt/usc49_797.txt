(2) A person adversely affected by a regulation prescribed under section 32912(c)(1) of this title may apply for review of the regulation by filing a petition for review in the court of appeals of the United States for the circuit in which the person resides or has its principal place of business.

(c) Additional Proceedings.—(1) When reviewing a regulation under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the court, on request of the petitioner, may order the Secretary or the Administrator to receive additional submissions if the court is satisfied the additional submissions are material and there were reasonable grounds for not presenting the submissions in the proceeding before the Secretary or Administrator.

In this section, the word “regulation” is substituted for “rule” for consistency in the revised title and because the terms are synonymous.
In subsection (a)(1) and (2), the words “apply for review” are added for clarity.
In subsection (a)(1), the text of 15:2004(a) (last sentence) is omitted because 15:2002(d) is executed and is not a part of the revised title.
In subsection (a)(2), the words “adversely affected” are substituted for “aggrieved”, and the words “regulation prescribed” are substituted for “final rule”, for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The text of 15:2004(a) (4th sentence) and 2008(e)(3)(B) is omitted because 5:ch. 7 applies unless otherwise stated.
In subsection (b), the words “a regulation prescribing an amendment of a standard submitted to Congress” are substituted for “or in the case of an amendment submitted to each House of Congress” in 15:2004(a), and the words “the Secretary of Transportation or the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, whoever prescribed the regulation” are substituted for “the officer who prescribed the rule”, for clarity. The words “a record of the proceeding in which the regulation was prescribed” are substituted for “the written submissions and other materials in the proceeding upon which such rule was based” in 15:2004(a) and “the written submissions to, and transcript of, the written and oral proceedings on which the rule was based, as provided in section 2112 of title 28, United States Code” in 15:2008(e)(3) for consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsection (c)(1), the words “on request of the petitioner” are substituted for “If the petitioner applies to the court in a proceeding under subsection (a) of this section for leave to make additional submissions”, and the words “to receive additional submissions” are substituted for “to provide additional opportunity to make such submissions”, for clarity.
In subsection (c)(2), the words “amend . . . the regulation” and “amended . . . regulation” are substituted for “modify . . . the rule” and “modified . . . rule”, respectively, for consistency in the chapter and because “regulation” is synonymous with “rule”.
In subsection (d), the words “affirming or setting aside, in whole or in part” are omitted as surplus. The words “and not in lieu of” in 15:2004(d) are omitted as surplus.
