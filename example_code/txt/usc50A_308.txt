â€œSec. 4. [Notice of approval or denial of applications; hearings; finality of determinations]. The Commission shall notify all applicants of the approval or denial of their applications and, if approved, shall notify such applicants of the amount for which such applications are approved. Any applicant whose application is denied, or is approved for less than the amount of such application, shall be entitled, under such regulations as the Commission may prescribe, to a hearing before the Commission or its representative with respect to such application. Upon such hearing, the Commission may affirm, modify, or reverse its former action with respect to such application, including a denial or reduction in the amount of award theretofore approved. All findings of the Commission concerning the persons to whom compensation pursuant to this Act is payable, and the amounts thereof, shall be conclusive and not be reviewable by any court.
