(C) whether it is in the best interest of the child receiving, and the particular foster grandparent providing, services in such a project, to continue the relationship between the child and the grandparent under this part after the child reaches the age of 21, if such child is an individual with a disability who was receiving such services prior to attaining the age of 21.

In establishing the amount of, and the effective date for, such adjustment, the Director, in consultation with the State Commissions on National and Community Service (as established under section 12638 of this title) and the heads of the State offices established under section 12651f of this title, shall consider the effect such adjustment will have on the ability of non-federally funded volunteer programs similar to the programs under this subchapter to maintain their current level of volunteer hours.


(e) “Low-income person” and “person of low income” definedFor purposes of this part, the terms “low-income person” and “person of low income” mean—(1) any person whose income is not more than 200 percent of the poverty line defined in section 9902(2) of this title and adjusted by the Director in the manner described in such section; and

(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), each recipient of a grant or contract to carry out a project under this part shall give equal treatment to all volunteers who participate in such project, without regard to whether such volunteers are eligible to receive a stipend under subsection (d) of this section.

(B) An individual who is not a low-income person may not become a volunteer under this part if allowing such individual to become a volunteer under this part would prevent a low-income individual from becoming a volunteer under this part or would displace a low-income person from being such a volunteer.


(3) The Director may not take into consideration or require as a condition of receiving a grant or contract to carry out a project under this part, any applicant for such grant or contract—(A) to accept or recruit individuals who are not low-income persons to serve as volunteers under this part; or
