â€œSec. 2. The Congress finds that new trends in the usage of 4-day workweeks, flexible work hours, and other variations in workday and workweek schedules in the private sector appear to show sufficient promise to warrant carefully designed, controlled, and evaluated experimentation by Federal agencies to determine whether and in what situations such varied work schedules can be successfully used by Federal agencies on a permanent basis. The Congress also finds that there should be sufficient flexibility in the work schedules of Federal employees to allow such employees to meet the obligations of their faith.
