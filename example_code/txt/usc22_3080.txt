§ 7553.

The first report shall be submitted not later than 60 days after December 4, 2002, the second report shall be submitted 90 days thereafter, and subsequent reports shall be submitted every 180 days thereafter through December 31, 2004.


(2) Further requirementsEach report, which shall be unclassified and posted upon the Department of State’s Internet website, shall include, by donor country, the total amount pledged, the amount delivered within the previous 60 days, the total amount of assistance delivered, the type of assistance and type of projects supported by the assistance.
