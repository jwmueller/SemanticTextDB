Congressional Findings Concerning Creation of Three Divisions in Central DistrictPub. L. 102–357, § 1, Aug. 26, 1992, 106 Stat. 958, provided that: 
“The Congress makes the following findings:
“(1) The Federal Government has the responsibility to provide quality services which are readily accessible to the people it serves.

“(2) The court facilities in the Central Judicial District of California are presently inadequate, and current and projected growth exacerbates the problem.

“(3) The population demographics of southern California have changed dramatically over the last decade, as the center of population shifts inland. Between 1980 and 1990, the population of Riverside County increased 76.5 percent, and San Bernardino County’s population increased 58.5 percent, to a combined population of 2,600,000.

“(4) In the next 15 years, the population in Riverside and San Bernardino Counties is expected to increase again by 70 percent, and 67 percent, respectively. By the year 2005, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties will have 4,400,000 residents.

“(5) As a result of the population growth, the freeways connecting the Pacific coast and the inland areas are tremendously overburdened, and Federal offices along the coast are no longer accessible to the residents of Riverside and San Bernardino Counties.

“(6) The creation of 3 divisions in the Central Judicial District of California is urgently needed to provide for the delivery of judicial services to all areas and all residents of the Central Judicial District of California.”
