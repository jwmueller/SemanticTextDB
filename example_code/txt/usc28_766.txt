§ 2506. Interest of witness
A witness in a suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims shall not be exempt or disqualified because he is a party to or interested in such suit.
(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 977; Pub. L. 97–164, title I, § 139(e), Apr. 2, 1982, 96 Stat. 42; Pub. L. 102–572, title IX, § 902(a)(1), Oct. 29, 1992, 106 Stat. 4516.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 274 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 186, 36 Stat. 1143; Feb. 5, 1912, ch. 28, 37 Stat. 61).
A provision that a witness should not be disqualified by color was omitted as obsolete and unnecessary, since no such disqualification could be invoked in absence of statutory authority.
A provision that the United States could examine any plaintiff or party interested is covered by the word “exempt” in the revised section, and by section 2504 of this title.
Changes were made in phraseology.
