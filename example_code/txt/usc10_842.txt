(4) Plan for ready reserve dependents.—A dental benefits plan for eligible dependents of members of the Ready Reserve of the reserve components who are not on active duty for more than 30 days.


(b) Administration of Plans.—The plans established under this section shall be administered under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense in consultation with the other administering Secretaries.

(c) Care Available Under Plans.—Dental plans established under subsection (a) may provide for the following dental care:(1) Diagnostic, oral examination, and preventive services and palliative emergency care.

(2) Basic restorative services of amalgam and composite restorations, stainless steel crowns for primary teeth, and dental appliance repairs.

(d) Premiums.—(1) Premium sharing plans.—(A) The dental insurance plan established under subsection (a)(1) and the dental benefits plans established under subsection (a)(3) are premium sharing plans.

(B) Members enrolled in a premium sharing plan for themselves or for their dependents shall be required to pay a share of the premium charged for the benefits provided under the plan. The member’s share of the premium charge may not exceed $20 per month for the enrollment.

(C) Effective as of January 1 of each year, the amount of the premium required under subparagraph (A) shall be increased by the percent equal to the lesser of—(i) the percent by which the rates of basic pay of members of the uniformed services are increased on such date; or

(D) The Secretary of Defense may reduce the monthly premium required to be paid under paragraph (1) in the case of enlisted members in pay grade E–1, E–2, E–3, or E–4 if the Secretary determines that such a reduction is appropriate to assist such members to participate in a dental plan referred to in subparagraph (A).

The regulations prescribed under subsection (b) shall specify the procedures for payment of the premiums by enrollees who do not receive such pay.


(e) Copayments Under Premium Sharing Plans.—(1) Except as provided pursuant to paragraph (2), a member or dependent who receives dental care under a premium sharing plan referred to in subsection (d)(1) shall—(A) in the case of care described in subsection (c)(1), pay no charge for the care;

(B) in the case of care described in subsection (c)(2), pay 20 percent of the charges for the care; and

(C) in the case of care described in subsection (c)(3), pay a percentage of the charges for the care that is determined appropriate by the Secretary of Defense, after consultation with the other administering Secretaries.


(2)(A) During a national emergency declared by the President or Congress and subject to regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary may waive, in whole or in part, the charges otherwise payable by a member of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve or a member of the Individual Ready Reserve under paragraph (1) for the coverage of the member alone under the dental insurance plan established under subsection (a)(1) if the Secretary determines that such waiver of the charges would facilitate or ensure the readiness of a unit or individual for deployment.

(B) The waiver under subparagraph (A) may apply only with respect to charges for coverage of dental care required for readiness.



(f) Transfer of Members.—If a member whose dependents are enrolled in the plan established under subsection (a)(3) is transferred to a duty station where dental care is provided to the member’s eligible dependents under a program other than that plan, the member may discontinue participation under the plan. If the member is later transferred to a duty station where dental care is not provided to such member’s eligible dependents except under the plan established under subsection (a)(3), the member may re-enroll the dependents in that plan.

(g) Care Outside the United States.—The Secretary of Defense may exercise the authority provided under subsection (a) to establish dental insurance plans and dental benefits plans for dental benefits provided outside the United States for the eligible members and dependents of members of the uniformed services.

(h) Waiver of Requirements for Surviving Dependents.—The Secretary of Defense may waive (in whole or in part) any requirements of a dental plan established under this section as the Secretary determines necessary for the effective administration of the plan for a dependent who is an eligible dependent described in subsection (k)(2).
