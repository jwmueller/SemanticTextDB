Historical and Revision Notes
1948 ActBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 467a (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 288A, as added Aug. 5, 1939, ch. 434, 53 Stat. 1205).
Words “upon any waters or vessel within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States” were substituted for “upon the high seas or on any waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and out of the jurisdiction of any particular State, or within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and out of the jurisdiction of any particular State on board any vessel belonging in whole or in part to the United States or any citizen thereof or to any corporation created by or under the laws of the United States, or of any State, Territory, or District thereof”, near beginning of section. The deleted words are not necessary in view of definitive section 7 of this title.
Words “whatsoever with intent to defraud” were omitted as being included in the preceding term “false pretenses”.
The punishment provision was revised to include a misdemeanor punishment (not more than $1,000 or one year, or both) where the offense involves $100 or less. (See reviser’s notes under sections 641 and 645 of this title.)
