The percentage determined under the preceding sentence shall be computed by taking into account the sum of such person’s direct 1986 exports (as determined by the Environmental Protection Agency) and such person’s indirect 1986 exports (as allocated to such person by such Agency in determining such person’s consumption and production rights for ozone-depleting chemicals).



(C) Separate application of limit for newly listed chemicals(i) In generalSubparagraph (B) shall be applied separately with respect to newly listed chemicals and other chemicals.
