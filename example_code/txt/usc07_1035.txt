§ 1471e. Additional assistance(a) Determination by SecretaryIn addition to the assistance provided under section 1471d of this title, if the Secretary determines that the livestock emergency also requires the implementation of one or more of the assistance programs described in subsection (b), the Secretary shall implement such programs.
