In subsection (a), the words “or a majority thereof” are omitted as unnecessary.
In subsection (b)(2), the words “section 1 of the Act of December 23, 1963 (Public Law 88–241, 77 Stat. 572)” are substituted for 40:72 (2d sentence words after “in accordance with”) because provisions in section 3 of the Act of August 30, 1890 (ch. 837, 26 Stat. 412), established the act as permanent and general. The act therefore was classified to 40:120, which was superseded by the Act of March 1, 1929 (ch. 416, 45 Stat. 1415), which was classified to 40:361 et seq. That law was repealed by section 21(b) of the Act of December 23, 1963 (Public Law 88–241, 77 Stat. 627), with the subject matter of those sections being restated in section 1 of that Act.

In subsection (c)(1), the words “Director of the National Park Service” are substituted for “Chief of Engineers of the United States Army” [subsequently changed to “Director of Public Buildings and Public Parks” by section 3 of the Act of February 26, 1925 (ch. 339, 43 Stat. 983)] because of section 1(words before 3d comma in 2d complete par. on p. 389) of the Act of March 2, 1934 (ch. 38, 48 Stat. 389).
In subsection (c)(2), the words “in Maryland or Virginia” are substituted for “outside the District of Columbia” for clarity and for consistency in this section. The words “such agreements to be subject to the approval of the President” are omitted because of 40:72 (last sentence), restated as subsection (d).
