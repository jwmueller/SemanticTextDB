Whenever a proposed reprograming exceeds $1,000,000 and the total amount proposed for obligation for a country under this chapter in a fiscal year exceeds by more than $5,000,000 the amount specified for that country in the report required by section 2413(a) of this title, notifications of such proposed reprogramings shall specify—(1) the nature and purpose of such proposed obligation, and

(2) to the extent possible at the time of the proposed obligation, the country for which such funds would otherwise have been obligated.


(b) ExceptionsThe notification requirement of this section does not apply to the reprogramming—(1) of funds to be used for an activity, program, or project under part I of subchapter I of this chapter if the amounts to be obligated for that activity, program, or project for that fiscal year do not exceed by more than 10 percent the amount justified to the Congress for that activity, program, or project for that fiscal year; or

(2) of less than $25,000 to be used under part VIII of subchapter I of this chapter, or under part V of subchapter II of this chapter, for a country for which a program under that part for that fiscal year was justified to the Congress.
