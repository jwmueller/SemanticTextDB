“(D) any government which was an ally of the Nazi government of Germany; or


“(2) pertain to any transaction as to which the United States Government, in its sole discretion, has grounds to believe—“(A) involved assets taken from persecuted persons during the period beginning on March 23, 1933, and ending on May 8, 1945, by, under the direction of, on behalf of, or under authority granted by the Nazi government of Germany or any nation then allied with that government; and

“(B) such transaction was completed without the assent of the owners of those assets or their heirs or assigns or other legitimate representatives.



“(b) Release of Records.—“(1) In general.—Subject to paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), the Nazi War Criminal Records Interagency Working Group shall release in their entirety Nazi war criminal records that are described in subsection (a).

“(2) Exception for privacy, etc.—An agency head may exempt from release under paragraph (1) specific information, that would—“(A) constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

“(B) reveal the identity of a confidential human source, or reveal information about the application of an intelligence source or method, or reveal the identity of a human intelligence source when the unauthorized disclosure of that source would clearly and demonstrably damage the national security interests of the United States;

“(C) reveal information that would assist in the development or use of weapons of mass destruction;

“(D) reveal information that would impair United States cryptologic systems or activities;

“(E) reveal information that would impair the application of state-of-the-art technology within a United States weapon system;

“(F) reveal actual United States military war plans that remain in effect;

“(G) reveal information that would seriously and demonstrably impair relations between the United States and a foreign government, or seriously and demonstrably undermine ongoing diplomatic activities of the United States;

“(J) violate a treaty or international agreement.


“(3) Application of exemptions.—“(A) In general.—In applying the exemptions listed in subparagraphs (B) through (J) of paragraph (2), there shall be a presumption that the public interest in the release of Nazi war criminal records will be served by disclosure and release of the records. Assertion of such exemption may only be made when the agency head determines that disclosure and release would be harmful to a specific interest identified in the exemption. An agency head who makes such a determination shall promptly report it to the committees of Congress with appropriate jurisdiction, including the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight [now Committee on Oversight and Government Reform] of the House of Representatives. The exemptions set forth in paragraph (2) shall constitute the only authority pursuant to which an agency head may exempt records otherwise subject to release under paragraph (1).

“(B) Application of title 5.—A determination by an agency head to apply an exemption listed in subparagraphs (B) through (I) of paragraph (2) shall be subject to the same standard of review that applies in the case of records withheld under section 552(b)(1) of title 5, United States Code.


“(4) Limitation on application.—This subsection shall not apply to records—“(A) related to or supporting any active or inactive investigation, inquiry, or prosecution by the Office of Special Investigations of the Department of Justice; or

“(B) solely in the possession, custody, or control of that office.



“(c) Inapplicability of National Security Act of 1947 Exemption.—Section 701(a) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 431[(a)]) [now 50 U.S.C. 3141(a)] shall not apply to any operational file, or any portion of any operational file, that constitutes a Nazi war criminal record under section 3 of this Act.
