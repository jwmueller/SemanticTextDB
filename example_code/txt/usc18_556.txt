Word “agency” was substituted for the words “independent establishment, board, commission” in two instances to eliminate any possible ambiguity as to scope of section. (See definitive section 6 of this title.)
Minor changes were made in phraseology.

Amendments2004—Pub. L. 108–458, which directed amendment of the third undesignated paragraph of this section by substituting “be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years or, if the offense involves international or domestic terrorism (as defined in section 2331), imprisoned not more than 8 years, or both” for “be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both”, was executed by making the substitution for “be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both”, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
