Congressional FindingsPub. L. 104–208, div. C, title I, § 108(a), Sept. 30, 1996, 110 Stat. 3009–557, provided that: 
“The Congress finds as follows:
“(1) Immigration checkpoints are an important component of the national strategy to prevent illegal immigration.

“(3) The pursuit of suspects fleeing immigration checkpoints is complicated by overlapping jurisdiction among Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers.”
