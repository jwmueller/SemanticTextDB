§ 505. Arrangements and public records(a) The Secretary of Transportation may require a motor carrier, motor carrier of migrant workers, or motor private carrier to file a copy of each arrangement related to a matter under this chapter that it has with another person. The Secretary may disclose the existence or contents of an arrangement between a motor contract carrier and a shipper filed under this section only if the disclosure is consistent with the public interest and is made as part of the record in a formal proceeding.

(b) Except as provided in subsection (a) of this section, all arrangements and statistics, tables, and figures contained in reports filed with the Secretary by a motor carrier under this chapter are public records. Such a public record, or a copy or extract of it, certified by the Secretary under seal is competent evidence in a proceeding of the Secretary, and, except as provided in section 504(f) of this title, in a judicial proceeding.

The section is included because 49:1655(f)(2) gave the same administrative powers exercised by the Interstate Commerce Commission under certain sections of title 49 to the Secretary of Transportation to carry out duties transferred to the Secretary by 49:1655(e). See the revision notes for section 501 of the revised title for an explanation of the transfer under 49:1655(f)(2). The powers of the Commission have been codified in subtitle IV of the revised title. The comparable provisions of title 49 that are represented by the section may be found as follows:

See the revision notes for the revised sections for an explanation of changes made in the text. Changes not accounted for in those revision notes are as follows:
In subsection (a), the text of 49:320(a) (proviso) is not included for motor carriers of migrant workers and motor private carriers because that provision, while included in the enumeration in 49:304(a)(3) and (3a), is not included in the specific enumeration of 49:1655(f)(2)(B)(ii). The text of 40:304(a)(3) (last sentence 1st–7th words) and (3a) (last sentence 1st–5th words) is omitted as executed. The words “also” and “with it” are omitted as surplus. The words “contract, agreement, or” are omitted as covered by “arrangement”. The words “carrier or” are omitted as covered by “person”. The words “related to a matter under this chapter” are substituted for “in relation to any traffic affected by the provisions of this chapter” for clarity because of section 501 of the revised title.
Subsection (b) does not apply to reports made to the Secretary by a rail carrier because 49:16(13) is not included in the specific enumeration of 49:1655(f)(2)(B)(ii). The subsection does not apply to motor carriers of migrant workers and motor private carriers because 49:304(d) only applies to motor carriers and 49:304(a)(3) and (3a) do not apply 49:304(d) to motor carriers of migrant workers and motor private carriers. References to schedules, classifications, and tariffs are omitted as not applicable to this chapter. The words “Except as provided in subsection (a) of this section” are added for clarity. The words “except as provided in section 504(f) of this title” are added for clarity and consistency because of the restatement of the chapter.
