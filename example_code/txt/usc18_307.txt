(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 738; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(H), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on sections 45 and 45b, of title 50, U.S.C., 1940 ed., War and National Defense (Jan. 12, 1938, ch. 2, §§ 1, 3, 52 Stat. 3).
Punishment provision of section 45 of title 50, U.S.C., 1940 ed., War and National Defense, is repeated. Words “upon conviction” were deleted as surplusage since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.
Minor changes were made in phraseology.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $1,000”.
