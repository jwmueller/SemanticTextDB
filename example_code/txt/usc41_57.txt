In subsection (a)(3), the words “under a basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or similar arrangement” are substituted for “referred to in clause (A)(ii)” for clarity. The words “by the Secretary of Commerce” are omitted as obsolete. The Secretary of Commerce no longer has responsibility for publishing notices of awards or orders. See revision note for subsection (d).
In subsection (b)(2), the text of 41 U.S.C. 416(C)(1)(H) is omitted because the procurement authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to the special procedures provided in section 833(c) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 339(c)) expired on September 30, 2007.
Subsection (b)(3) is added because of section 850(e)(3) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 (Public Law 105–85, 111 Stat. 1849, 15:637 note), which in part provided that the amendments made by section 850(e)(2), which amended 41:416(c)(1), be implemented in a manner consistent with applicable international agreements.
Subsection (d) is substituted for 41:416(a)(2) and (7) to eliminate unnecessary words. Federal Business Opportunities is the designated single point of universal electronic public access for publication of all procurement information and notices previously published by the Secretary of Commerce in the Commerce Business Daily. See 66 Fed. Reg. 27407, May 16, 2001, 68 Fed. Reg. 56678, October 1, 2003, 48 CFR ch. 1, subch. B, part 5, and the special notice posted in CBDNet on December 28, 2001, and printed on January 2, 2002. The special notice can be found by going to http://cbdnet.gpo.gov and clicking on “Federal Business Opportunities to replace the Commerce Business Daily”.
In subsection (e)(1)(B)(i), the words “required for a bid or proposal for a contract described in” are substituted for “required by” for clarity.
