§ 3191. Purposes and findings relating to animal health and disease research(a) PurposesThe purposes of this subchapter are to—(1) promote the general welfare through the improved health and productivity of domestic livestock, poultry, aquatic animals, and other income-producing animals that are essential to the food supply of the United States and the welfare of producers and consumers of animal products;

(2) improve the health of horses;

(3) facilitate the effective treatment of, and, to the extent possible, prevent animal and poultry diseases in both domesticated and wild animals that, if not controlled, would be disastrous to the United States livestock and poultry industries and endanger the food supply of the United States;

(4) improve methods for the control of organisms and residues in food products of animal origin that could endanger the human food supply;

(5) improve the housing and management of animals to improve the well-being of livestock production species;

(6) minimize livestock and poultry losses due to transportation and handling;

(7) protect human health through control of animal diseases transmissible to humans;

(8) improve methods of controlling the births of predators and other animals; and

(9) otherwise promote the general welfare through expanded programs of research and extension to improve animal health.


(b) FindingsCongress finds that—(1) the total animal health and disease research and extension efforts of State colleges and universities and of the Federal Government would be more effective if there were close coordination between the efforts; and

(2) colleges and universities having accredited schools or colleges of veterinary medicine and State agricultural experiment stations that conduct animal health and disease research are especially vital in training research workers in animal health and related disciplines.

Studies on Agricultural Research and TechnologyPub. L. 107–171, title X, § 10907, May 13, 2002, 116 Stat. 538, provided that:
“(a) Scientific Studies.—“(1) In general.—The Secretary of Agriculture may conduct scientific studies on—“(A) the transmission of spongiform encephalopathy in deer, elk, and moose; and

“(B) chronic wasting disease (including the risks that chronic wasting disease poses to livestock).


“(2) Report.—The Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate a report on the results of any scientific studies conducted under paragraph (1).


“(b) Vaccines.—“(1) Vaccine storage study.—The Secretary may—“(A) conduct a study to determine the number of doses of livestock disease vaccines that should be available to protect against livestock diseases that could be introduced into the United States; and

“(B) compare that number with the number of doses of the livestock disease vaccines that are available as of that date.


“(2) Stockpiling of vaccines.—If, after conducting the study and comparison described in paragraph (1), the Secretary determines that there is an insufficient number of doses of a particular vaccine referred to in that paragraph, the Secretary may take such actions as are necessary to obtain the required additional doses of the vaccine.”
