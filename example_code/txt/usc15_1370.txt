Congressional Findings and Declaration of PurposesSection 2605(a) of div. A of Pub. L. 104–208 provided that:
“(1) Findings.—The Congress finds that—“(A) competition among the various financial institutions and other firms engaged in the business of consumer leasing is greatest when there is informed use of leasing;

“(B) the informed use of leasing results from an awareness of the cost of leasing by consumers; and

“(C) there has been a continued trend toward leasing automobiles and other durable goods for consumer use as an alternative to installment credit sales and that leasing product advances have occurred such that lessors have been unable to provide consistent industry-wide disclosures to fully account for the competitive progress that has occurred.


“(2) Purposes.—The purposes of this section are—“(A) to assure a simple, meaningful disclosure of leasing terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various leasing terms available to the consumer and avoid the uninformed use of leasing, and to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair leasing practices;

“(B) to provide for adequate cost disclosures that reflect the marketplace without impairing competition and the development of new leasing products; and

“(C) to provide the Board with the regulatory authority to assure a simplified, meaningful definition and disclosure of the terms of certain leases of personal property for personal, family, or household purposes so as to—“(i) enable the lessee to compare more readily the various lease terms available to the lessee;

“(ii) enable comparison of lease terms with credit terms, as appropriate; and

“(iii) assure meaningful and accurate disclosures of lease terms in advertisements.”
