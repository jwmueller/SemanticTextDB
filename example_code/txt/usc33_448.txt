Codification
The last sentence of this section is from a provision accompanying an appropriation for the expenses of the Commission in the Sundry Civil Appropriation Act for 1901, which originally read as follows: “So much of the Act of March third, eighteen hundred and ninety-nine, as provides that the members of the California Debris Commission shall receive only actual expenses in lieu of mileage while traveling on duty is hereby repealed, and hereafter the officers of the commission shall receive the mileage allowed by law.”

Act Mar. 3, 1899, ch. 424, § 1, 30 Stat. 1109, mentioned in said provision, provided that the officers of the Commission traveling on duty might be paid their actual traveling expenses, in lieu of mileage allowed by law, and should thereafter receive no mileage.

California Debris Commission abolished and functions transferred to Secretary of the Army by Pub. L. 99–662, title XI, § 1106, Nov. 17, 1986, 100 Stat. 4229, set out as a note under section 661 of this title.
