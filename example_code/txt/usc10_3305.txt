The words “at his discretion and”, “belonging to the Government, and which can be spared for that purpose”, and “in each case” are omitted as surplusage. The words “high schools of the” are substituted for the words “High School of Washington”, since the various high schools of the District of Columbia have succeeded the Washington High School that existed at the time the statute was enacted. The words “except for property properly expended” are inserted for clarity.
