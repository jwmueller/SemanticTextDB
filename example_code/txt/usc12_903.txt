Such certificate shall be conclusive evidence to the Secretary of the employment status of the mortgagor and of the mortgagor’s need for housing.


(b) Certification of housing need to Secretary; guaranty from loss; authorization of appropriationsNo mortgage shall be insured under this section unless the Secretary of Defense or his designee shall have certified to the Secretary that the housing is necessary to provide adequate housing for such civilians employed in connection with such a research or development installation and that there is no present intention to substantially curtail the number of such civilian personnel assigned or to be assigned to such installation. Such certification shall be conclusive evidence to the Secretary of the need for such housing but if the Secretary determines that insurance of mortgages on such housing is not an acceptable risk, he may require the Secretary of Defense to guarantee the General Insurance Fund from loss with respect to mortgages insured pursuant to this section: Provided, That the Secretary shall relieve the Secretary of Defense from any obligation to guarantee the General Insurance Fund from loss with respect to a mortgage assumed by a person ineligible to receive a certificate under subsection (a), if the original mortgagor is issued another certificate with respect to a mortgage insured under this section on property which the Secretary determines is not an acceptable risk. There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to provide for payment to meet losses arising from such guaranty.


(c) Economic soundness of propertyThe Secretary may accept any mortgage for insurance under this section without regard to any requirement in any other section of this chapter, that the project or property be economically sound or an acceptable risk.
