Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 220 of title 22, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Foreign Relations and Intercourse (June 15, 1917, ch. 30, title IX, § 2, 40 Stat. 227; Mar. 28, 1940, ch. 72, § 7, 54 Stat. 80).
Mandatory-punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.
Punishment of five years’ imprisonment was substituted for “ten years” to conform with other sections embracing offenses of comparable gravity.
Minor changes were made in phraseology.

Amendments2002—Pub. L. 107–273 substituted “to facilitate” for “to facility” in last par.
1996—Pub. L. 104–208 substituted “imprisoned not more than 25 years (if the offense was committed to facilitate an act of international terrorism (as defined in section 2331 of this title)), 20 years (if the offense was committed to facilitate a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 929(a) of this title)), 10 years (in the case of the first or second such offense, if the offense was not committed to facility such an act of international terrorism or a drug trafficking crime), or 15 years (in the case of any other offense)” for “imprisoned not more than 10 years” in last par.

L. 103–322, § 330016(1)(I), which directed the amendment of this section by substituting “under this title” for “not more than $2,000”, could not be executed because the words “not more than $2,000” did not appear in text subsequent to amendment by Pub. L. 103–322, § 130009(a)(2). See below.
