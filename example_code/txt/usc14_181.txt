§ 424. Limitations on retirement and retired pay(a) The provisions of any section of this title shall not be construed so as to prevent any member from being placed on the retired list with the highest grade or rate and the highest retired pay to which the member may be entitled under the provisions of any other section of this title or under any other law.

(b) In no case may the retired pay of a member exceed 75 percent of (1) the sum of the active-duty pay and all permanent additions thereto (including longevity credit to which the member is entitled) of the grade or rate on which the member’s pay is computed, or (2) the retired pay base determined under section 1407 of title 10, as appropriate.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 525; Pub. L. 98–557, § 15(a)(3)(A), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2865; Pub. L. 99–348, title II, § 205(b)(11), July 1, 1986, 100 Stat. 700.)

Historical and Revision NotesThe two provisions of this section are considered desirable as safeguards to eliminate any possible misconstruction of situations relating to retirement and retired pay in respect to the two points covered. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

Amendments1986—Pub. L. 99–348 amended section generally. Prior to amendment, section read as follows: “The provisions of any section of this title shall not be construed so as to prevent any officer or enlisted member from being placed on the retired list with the highest grade or rating and the highest retired pay to which such officer or enlisted member may be entitled under the provisions of any other section of this title or under the provisions of any other law. In no case shall the retired pay of an officer or enlisted member exceed 75 percent of the sum of the active-duty pay and all permanent additions thereto, including longevity credit to which the officer or enlisted member concerned is entitled, of the grade or rating on which his pay is computed.”
1984—Pub. L. 98–557 substituted reference to enlisted member for reference to enlisted man in four places.
