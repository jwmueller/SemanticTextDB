§ 15506. Supplements to Federal grant programs(a) Finding.—Congress finds that certain States and local communities of the region, including local development districts, may be unable to take maximum advantage of Federal grant programs for which the States and communities are eligible because—(1) they lack the economic resources to provide the required matching share; or

(2) there are insufficient funds available under the applicable Federal law with respect to a project to be carried out in the region.


(b) Federal Grant Program Funding.—A Commission, with the approval of the Federal Cochairperson, may use amounts made available to carry out this subtitle—(1) for any part of the basic Federal contribution to projects or activities under the Federal grant programs authorized by Federal laws; and

(2) to increase the Federal contribution to projects and activities under the programs above the fixed maximum part of the cost of the projects or activities otherwise authorized by the applicable law.


(c) Certification Required.—For a program, project, or activity for which any part of the basic Federal contribution to the project or activity under a Federal grant program is proposed to be made under subsection (b), the Federal contribution shall not be made until the responsible Federal official administering the Federal law authorizing the Federal contribution certifies that the program, project, or activity meets the applicable requirements of the Federal law and could be approved for Federal contribution under that law if amounts were available under the law for the program, project, or activity.

(d) Limitations in Other Laws Inapplicable.—Amounts provided pursuant to this subtitle are available without regard to any limitations on areas eligible for assistance or authorizations for appropriation in any other law.

(e) Federal Share.—The Federal share of the cost of a project or activity receiving assistance under this section shall not exceed 80 percent.

(f) Maximum Commission Contribution.—Section 15501(d), relating to limitations on Commission contributions, shall apply to a program, project, or activity receiving assistance under this section.
