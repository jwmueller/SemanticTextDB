In clause (1), the word “assistance” is substituted for “ ‘Federal assistance’, ‘Federal assistance programs’, or ‘federally assisted programs’ ” for consistency in the revised title and to have only one defined term in the chapter. The words “the transfer of anything of value for a public purpose of support or stimulation that is (A) authorized by a law of the United States” are substituted for “programs that provide assistance” for consistency with section 6101(3) of the revised title. The words “section 502 of the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act (Public Law 93–198, 87 Stat. 813, D.C. Code § 47–3406)” are substituted for “article VI of the District of Columbia Revenue Act of 1947 (D.C. Code secs. 47–2501a and 47–2501b)” because the former has superseded the latter.
Clause (3) restates the source provisions because of the definition of “executive agency” in section 102 of the revised title.
In clause (4)(A) and (B), the word “grant” is substituted for “ ‘grant’ or ‘grant-in-aid’ ” for consistency in the revised title and to have only one defined term in the chapter.
In clause (4)(B), the words “a private, nonprofit community organization eligible to receive amounts under the Community Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 9901 et seq.)” are substituted for “a community action agency under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as amended” because of section 683(c)(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (Pub. L. 97–35, 95 Stat. 519).
In clause (4)(C), the words “whether public or private” are omitted as surplus. The words “law of the United States” are substituted for “Federal laws” for consistency.
In clause (5), the words “head of a Federal agency” are omitted as unnecessary because heads of Federal agencies already have the authority to delegate.
In clause (6), the words “local government” are substituted for “ ‘political subdivision’ or ‘local government’ ” for consistency in the revised title and to have only one defined term in the chapter. The words “unit of general local government” are substituted for “local unit of government, including specifically a county, municipality, city, town, township” to incorporate the definition in clause (9).
In clause (7), the words “public-purpose local government” are substituted for “public-purpose corporation or other strictly limited purpose political subdivision” to eliminate unnecessary words.
In clause (8), the words “the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico” are omitted as being included in “territory or possession of the United States” and as necessary because of 48:734.
In clause (9), the word “parish” is omitted as included in county because of 1:2.
