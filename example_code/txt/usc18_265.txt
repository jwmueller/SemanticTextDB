(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 731; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(H), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147; Pub. L. 104–294, title VI, § 606(a), Oct. 11, 1996, 110 Stat. 3511.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 467 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 288, 35 Stat. 1145).
Same language was inserted as in section 661 of this title for the same reason.
Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.
The smaller punishment for an offense involving $100 or less was added. (See reviser’s notes under sections 641 and 645 of this title.)
This accords with the recommendation of United States Attorney P. F. Herrick of Puerto Rico.
Language as to order of trial was omitted and incorporated in section 3435 of this title.

Amendments1996—Pub. L. 104–294 substituted “$1,000” for “$100”.
1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $1,000” in two places.
