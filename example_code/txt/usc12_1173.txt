Each of the banks of the System, in order to obtain funds for its authorized purposes, shall have power, subject to regulation by the Farm Credit Administration, and subject to the limitations of paragraph (e) of this section, to—(a) Borrow money from or loan to any other institution of the System, borrow from any commercial bank or other lending institution, issue its notes or other evidence of debt on its own individual responsibility and full faith and credit, and invest its excess funds in such sums, at such times, and on such terms and conditions as it may determine.

(b) Issue its own notes, bonds, debentures, or other similar obligations, fully collateralized as provided in section 2154(c) of this title by the notes, mortgages, and security instruments it holds in the performance of its functions under this chapter in such sums, maturities, rates of interest, and terms and conditions of each issue as it may determine with approval of the Farm Credit Administration.

(d) Join with other banks of the System in issuance of System-wide notes, bonds, debentures, and other obligations in the manner, form, amounts, and on such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon with approval of the Farm Credit Administration. Such System-wide issue by the participating banks and such participations by each bank shall not exceed the limits to which each such bank is subject in the issuance of its individual or consolidated obligations and each such issue shall be subject to approval of the Farm Credit Administration: Provided, however, There shall be no issues of System-wide obligations without the concurrence of the boards of directors of each bank and the approval of the Farm Credit Administration for such issues shall be conditioned on and be evidence of the compliance with this provision.

(e) No bank or banks shall issue notes, bonds, debentures, or other obligations individually or in concert with one or more banks of the System other than through the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation under any provision of this chapter except under subsection (a) of this section: Provided, That any bank or banks may issue investment bonds or like obligations other than through the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation if the interest rate is not in excess of the interest allowable on savings deposits of commercial banks of comparable amounts and maturities under Federal Reserve regulation on its member banks.
