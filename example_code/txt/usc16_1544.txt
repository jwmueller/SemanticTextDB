“(4) the French settlement on the Island in 1604 and 1605 was the initial site of the first permanent settlement in the New World, predating the English settlement of 1607 at Jamestown, Virginia;

“(5) many people view the expedition that settled on the Island in 1604 as the beginning of the Acadian culture in North America;
