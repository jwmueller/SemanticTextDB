In clause (12), the word “individuals” is substituted for “commuters or others” to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (13)(A), the words “in the case of any such area” and “entire” are omitted as surplus. The words “Secretary of Commerce” are substituted for “Bureau of the Census” because of 15:1511(e).
