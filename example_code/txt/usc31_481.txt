In the section, before clause (1), the words “for a project to be financed by at least 2 assistance programs” are substituted for “under two or more Federal programs in support of any project” for consistency in the revised chapter. The words “shall take action” are substituted for “Actions taken by Federal agency heads pursuant to this chapter that relate to”, and the words “that will ensure” are substituted for “shall be designed to assure”, to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “so far as reasonably possible” are omitted as surplus. In clause (4), the word “impediments” is omitted as surplus. The word “providing” is substituted for “Federal provision of”, and the words “joint assistance under the application” are substituted for “on a joint basis”, to eliminate unnecessary words. Clause (5) is substituted for 42:4253(5) because of the restatement.
