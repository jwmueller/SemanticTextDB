(B) To the extent that there remain unpaid principal balances on awards to claimants which were, on the date of nationalization or other taking of property, nonprofit organizations operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare, religious, charitable, or educational purposes (after payments made to such nonprofit organizations pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) are taken into account), the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to make payments from time to time on account of the unpaid principal balance of each remaining award to such nonprofit organizations which bear to such unpaid principal balance the same proportion as the total sums aggregated pursuant to subparagraph (A) at the times such payments are made bear to the aggregate unpaid principal balance of all such awards to nonprofit organizations.
