“SEC. 102. SENSE OF CONGRESS.“It is the sense of Congress that—“(1) Federal agencies should not retaliate for court judgments or settlements relating to discrimination and whistleblower laws by targeting the claimant or other employees with reductions in compensation, benefits, or workforce to pay for such judgments or settlements;

“(2) the mission of the Federal agency and the employment security of employees who are blameless in a whistleblower incident should not be compromised;

“(3) Federal agencies should not use a reduction in force or furloughs as means of funding a reimbursement under this Act;

“(4)(A) accountability in the enforcement of employee rights is not furthered by terminating—“(i) the employment of other employees; or

“(ii) the benefits to which those employees are entitled through statute or contract; and


“(B) this Act is not intended to authorize those actions;


“(5)(A) nor is accountability furthered if Federal agencies react to the increased accountability under this Act by taking unfounded disciplinary actions against managers or by violating the procedural rights of managers who have been accused of discrimination; and

“(B) Federal agencies should ensure that managers have adequate training in the management of a diverse workforce and in dispute resolution and other essential communication skills; and


“(6)(A) Federal agencies are expected to reimburse the General Fund of the Treasury within a reasonable time under this Act; and

“(B) a Federal agency, particularly if the amount of reimbursement under this Act is large relative to annual appropriations for that agency, may need to extend reimbursement over several years in order to avoid—“(i) reductions in force;

“(ii) furloughs;

“(iii) other reductions in compensation or benefits for the workforce of the agency; or

“(iv) an adverse effect on the mission of the agency.
