(3) a passenger motor vehicle for which an application for an exemption under section 30013(b) 11 So in original. Probably should be section “30113(b)”. of this title has been filed in accordance with the requirements of that section.

(3) savings in consumer time and inconvenience; and

(4) health and safety, including emission standards.


(e) Procedures.—Section 553 of title 5 applies to a standard prescribed under this section. However, the Secretary shall give an interested person an opportunity to make oral and written presentations of information, views, and arguments. A transcript of each oral presentation shall be kept. Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, the Secretary may conduct a hearing to resolve an issue of fact material to a standard.

(f) Effective Date.—The Secretary shall prescribe an effective date for a standard under this section. That date may not be earlier than the date the standard is prescribed nor later than 18 months after the date the standard is prescribed.
