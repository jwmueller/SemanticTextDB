Historical and Revision Notes


DerivationU.S. CodeRevised Statutes andStatutes at Large


 [Uncodified].1950 Reorg. Plan No. 2, § 5 eff. May 24, 1950, 64 Stat. 1261.


The title of the position was changed to “Assistant Attorney General for Administration” by § 307 of the Act of Aug. 14, 1964, Pub. L. 88–426, 78 Stat. 432.
The words “competitive service” are substituted for “classified civil service” because the term “classified civil service” formerly used to designate the merit system established by the Civil Service Act of 1883 has become ambiguous due to the creation of the “classified” pay system. The term “competitive service” is now customarily used, and appears throughout title 5, United States Code, in place of “classified civil service”.
The words “There shall be in the Department of Justice” are omitted as unnecessary as the title of the position and the fact of appointment by the Attorney General establish the location of the position in the Department of Justice.
The last 12 words of section 5 of the Reorganization Plan are omitted on authority of the Act of June 5, 1952, ch. 369, § 1101 (3d proviso), 66 Stat. 121. The salary of the position is now fixed by § 303(e) of the Act of Aug. 14, 1964, Pub. L. 88–426, 78 Stat. 420, which is codified in section 5316 of title 5, United States Code.
