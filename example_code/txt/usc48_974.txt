“Section 254“(a) In determining any income tax imposed by the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands shall have authority to impose tax upon income derived by a resident of the Republic of the Marshall Islands from sources without the Republic of the Marshall Islands, in the same manner and to the same extent as the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands imposes tax upon income derived from within its own jurisdiction. If the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands exercises such authority as provided in this subsection, any individual resident of the Republic of the Marshall Islands who is subject to tax by the Government of the United States on income which is also taxed by the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands shall be relieved of liability to the Government of the United States for the tax which, but for this subsection, would otherwise be imposed by the Government of the United States on such income. However, the relief from liability to the United States Government referred to in the preceding sentence means only relief in the form of the foreign tax credit (or deduction in lieu thereof) available with respect to the income taxes of a possession of the United States, and relief in the form of the exclusion under section 911 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. For purposes of this section, the term ‘resident of the Republic of the Marshall Islands’ shall be deemed to include any person who was physically present in the Republic of the Marshall Islands for a period of 183 or more days during any taxable year.

“(b) If the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands subjects income to taxation substantially similar to that which was imposed by the Trust Territory Code in effect on January 1, 1980, such Government shall be deemed to have exercised the authority described in section 254(a).
