In this section, the words “section 1132, 1134(b) or (f)(1) (related to an aircraft accident), or 1155(a) of this title” are substituted for “issued under this chapter” and “provisions of this chapter” because those sections restate the relevant provisions of 49 App.:ch. 20 carried out by the National Transportation Safety Board.
In subsections (a) and (b), the word “rule” is omitted as being synonymous with “regulation”. The word “requirement” is omitted as being included in “order”.
