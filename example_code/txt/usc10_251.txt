“SEC. 533. IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL FITNESS OF RECRUITS.“(a) In General.—The Secretary of Defense shall take steps to improve the physical fitness of recruits before they enter basic training.

“(b) Specific Steps.—As part of those improvements, the Secretary shall take the following steps:“(1) Direct the Secretary of each military department to implement programs under which new recruits who are in the Delayed Entry Program are encouraged to participate in physical fitness activities before reporting to basic training.

“(2) Develop a range of incentives for new recruits to participate in physical fitness programs, as well as for those recruits who improve their level of fitness while in the Delayed Entry Program, which may include access to Department of Defense military fitness facilities, and access to military medical facilities in the case of a recruit who is injured while participating in physical activities with recruiters or other military personnel.

“(3) Evaluate whether partnerships between recruiters and reserve components, or other innovative arrangements, could provide a pool of qualified personnel to assist in the conduct of physical training programs for new recruits in the Delayed Entry Program.”
