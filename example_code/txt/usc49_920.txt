§ 41107. Transportation of mail
When the United States Postal Service finds that the needs of the Postal Service require the transportation of mail by aircraft in foreign air transportation or between places in Alaska, in addition to the transportation of mail authorized under certificates in effect, the Postal Service shall certify that finding to the Secretary of Transportation with a statement about the additional transportation and facilities necessary to provide the additional transportation. A copy of each certification and statement shall be posted for at least 20 days in the office of the Secretary. After notice and an opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary shall issue a new certificate under section 41102 of this title, or amend or modify an existing certificate under section 41110(a)(2)(A) of this title, to provide the additional transportation and facilities if the Secretary finds the additional transportation is required by the public convenience and necessity.

 49 App.:1551(a)(4)(A) (related to 49 App.:1371(m)), (b)(1)(E).Aug. 23, 1958, Pub. L. 85–726, 72 Stat. 731, § 1601(a)(4)(A) (related to § 401(m)), (b)(1)(E); added Oct. 4, 1984, Pub. L. 98–443, § 3(c), (e), 98 Stat. 1703, 1704.


The words “from time to time” are omitted as surplus. The words “United States Postal Service” and “Postal Service” are substituted for “Postmaster General” in section 401(m) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Public Law 85–726, 72 Stat. 757) because of sections 4(a) and 6(o) of the Postal Reorganization Act (Public Law 91–375, 84 Stat. 773, 783). The words “in foreign air transportation or between places in Alaska” are substituted for “between any points within the United States or between the United States and foreign countries” for consistency in the revised title and because 49 App.:1551(a)(4)(A) provides that 49 App.:1371(m) no longer applies to interstate or overseas air transportation (except transportation of mail between 2 places in Alaska). In addition, Congress did not intend to maintain the regulation of domestic air transportation of mail. See section 40102(a) of the revised title defining “air transportation” to mean interstate or foreign air transportation or the transportation of mail by aircraft. The word “currently” is omitted as surplus. The words “opportunity for a” are added for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words “or certificates” are omitted as surplus because of 1:1. The word “modify” is added for consistency in the revised title.
