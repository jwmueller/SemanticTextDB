This section is derived from 45:802 for clarity. That section contains definitions for the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (Public Law 94–210, 90 Stat. 33). Title VII of that Act is the source of the source provisions restated in this chapter. However, other titles of that Act are not being restated because they are outside the scope of the restatement. Therefore, 45:802 is not being restated in this restatement and only the relevant definitions are accounted for in this chapter.
