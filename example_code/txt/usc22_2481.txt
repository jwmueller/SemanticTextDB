(3) to adjust for costs and procedures of obtaining benefits for missions of the United States abroad,

(4) to assist in resolving a dispute affecting United States interests and involving a foreign mission or sending State, or

(d) Agent for waiver of recourseFor purposes of effectuating a waiver of recourse which is required under this section, the Secretary may designate any officer of the Department of State as the agent of a foreign mission (or of any assignee of or person deriving rights from a foreign mission). Any such waiver by an officer so designated shall for all purposes (including any court or administrative proceeding) be deemed to be a waiver by the foreign mission (or the assignee of or other person deriving rights from a foreign mission).


(e) Secret Service protectionNothing in this chapter shall be deemed to preclude or limit in any way the authority of the United States Secret Service to provide protective services pursuant to section 3056 or 3056A of title 18 at a level commensurate with protective requirements as determined by the United States Secret Service.

(2) The Secretary of State may acquire property in the United States for the purposes of subsection (b)(5) of this section only in the context of a specific reciprocal agreement with a specified foreign government. Property acquired by the United States in the foreign country through such an exchange shall benefit the United States at least to the same extent as the property acquired in the United States benefits the foreign government.
