Ex. Ord. No. 12648, Aug. 11, 1988, 53 F.R. 30637, provided:
The United States of America deposited its instrument of ratification of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (“Convention”) on April 29, 1988. The Convention entered into force for the United States on July 1, 1988. Article 6 of the Convention imposes upon Contracting States an obligation to designate a “Central Authority” for the purpose of discharging certain specified functions.
In order that the Government of the United States of America may give full and complete effect to the Convention, and pursuant to section 7 of the International Child Abduction Remedies Act, Public Law No. 100–300 (1988) [22 U.S.C. 9006], it is expedient and necessary that I designate a Central Authority within the Executive branch of said Government:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 301 of Title 3 of the United States Code and section 7 of the International Child Abduction Remedies Act, it is ordered as follows:
Section 1. Designation of Central Authority. The Department of State is hereby designated as the Central Authority of the United States for purposes of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. The Secretary of State is hereby authorized and empowered, in accordance with such regulations as he may prescribe, to perform all lawful acts that may be necessary and proper in order to execute the functions of the Central Authority in a timely and efficient manner.
