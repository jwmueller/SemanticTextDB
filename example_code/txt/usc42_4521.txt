§ 5306. Allocation and distribution of funds(a) Amounts allocated to Indian tribes, discretionary fund, and metropolitan cities and urban counties; limitations on amount of annual grants(1) For each fiscal year, of the amount approved in appropriation Acts under section 5303 of this title for grants for such fiscal year (excluding the amounts provided for use in accordance with section 5307 of this title), the Secretary shall reserve for grants to Indian tribes 1 percent of the amount appropriated under such section. The Secretary shall provide for distribution of amounts under this paragraph to Indian tribes on the basis of a competition conducted pursuant to specific criteria for the selection of Indian tribes to receive such amounts. The criteria shall be contained in a regulation promulgated by the Secretary after notice and public comment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, such grants to Indian tribes shall not be subject to the requirements of section 5304 of this title, except subsections (f), (g), and (k) of such section.

(2) For each fiscal year, of the amount approved in appropriation Acts under section 5303 of this title for grants for such fiscal year (excluding the amounts provided for use in accordance with section 5307 of this title), the Secretary shall reserve for grants to insular areas $7,000,000. The Secretary shall provide for distribution of amounts under this paragraph to insular areas on the basis of the ratio of the population of each insular area to the population of all insular areas. In determining the distribution of amounts to insular areas, the Secretary may also include other statistical criteria as data become available from the Bureau of the Census, but only if such criteria are contained in a regulation promulgated by the Secretary after notice and public comment.

(3) After reserving such amounts for Indian tribes under paragraph (1) and after reserving such amounts for insular areas under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall allocate amounts provided for use under section 5307 of this title.

(4) Of the amount remaining after allocations pursuant to paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), 70 percent shall be allocated by the Secretary to metropolitan cities and urban counties. Except as otherwise specifically authorized, each metropolitan city and urban county shall be entitled to an annual grant from such allocation in an amount not exceeding its basic amount computed pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (b) of this section.


(b) Computation of amount allocated to metropolitan cities and urban counties(1) The Secretary shall determine the amount to be allocated to each metropolitan city which shall be the greater of an amount that bears the same ratio to the allocation for all metropolitan areas as either—(A) the average of the ratios between—(i) the population of that city and the population of all metropolitan areas;

(ii) the extent of poverty in that city and the extent of poverty in all metropolitan areas; and

(iii) the extent of housing overcrowding in that city and the extent of housing overcrowding in all metropolitan areas; or


(B) the average of the ratios between—(i) the extent of growth lag in that city and the extent of growth lag in all metropolitan cities;

(ii) the extent of poverty in that city and the extent of poverty in all metropolitan areas; and

(iii) the age of housing in that city and the age of housing in all metropolitan areas.



(2) The Secretary shall determine the amount to be allocated to each urban county, which shall be the greater of an amount that bears the same ratio to the allocation for all metropolitan areas as either—(A) the average of the ratios between—(i) the population of that urban county and the population of all metropolitan areas;

(ii) the extent of poverty in that urban county and the extent of poverty in all metropolitan areas; and

(iii) the extent of housing overcrowding in that urban county and the extent of housing overcrowding in all metropolitan areas; or


(B) the average of the ratios between—(i) the extent of growth lag in that urban county and the extent of growth lag in all metropolitan cities and urban counties;

(ii) the extent of poverty in that urban county and the extent of poverty in all metropolitan areas; and

(iii) the age of housing in that urban county and the age of housing in all metropolitan areas.



(3) In determining the average of ratios under paragraphs (1)(A) and (2)(A), the ratio involving the extent of poverty shall be counted twice, and each of the other ratios shall be counted once; and in determining the average of ratios under paragraphs (1)(B) and (2)(B), the ratio involving the extent of growth lag shall be counted once, the ratio involving the extent of poverty shall be counted one and one-half times, and the ratio involving the age of housing shall be counted two and one-half times.

(4) In computing amounts or exclusions under this section with respect to any urban county, there shall be excluded units of general local government located in the county the populations of which are not counted in determining the eligibility of the urban county to receive a grant under this subsection, except that there shall be included any independent city (as defined by the Bureau of the Census) which—(A) is not part of any county;

(B) is not eligible for a grant pursuant to subsection (b)(1) of this section;

(C) is contiguous to the urban county;

(D) has entered into cooperation agreements with the urban county which provide that the urban county is to undertake or to assist in the undertaking of essential community development and housing assistance activities with respect to such independent city; and

(E) is not included as a part of any other unit of general local government for purposes of this section.


Any independent city which is included in any fiscal year for purposes of computing amounts pursuant to the preceding sentence shall not be eligible to receive assistance under subsection (d) of this section with respect to such fiscal year.

(5) In computing amounts under this section with respect to any urban county, there shall be included all of the area of any unit of local government which is part of, but is not located entirely within the boundaries of, such urban county if the part of such unit of local government which is within the boundaries of such urban county would otherwise be included in computing the amount for such urban county under this section, and if the part of such unit of local government which is not within the boundaries of such urban county is not included as a part of any other unit of local government for the purpose of this section. Any amount received by such urban county under this section may be used with respect to the part of such unit of local government which is outside the boundaries of such urban county.

(6)(A) Where data are available, the amount determined under paragraph (1) for a metropolitan city that has been formed by the consolidation of one or more metropolitan cities with an urban county shall be equal to the sum of the amounts that would have been determined under paragraph (1) for the metropolitan city or cities and the balance of the consolidated government, if such consolidation had not occurred. This paragraph shall apply only to any consolidation that—(i) included all metropolitan cities that received grants under this section for the fiscal year preceding such consolidation and that were located within the urban county;

(ii) included the entire urban county that received a grant under this section for the fiscal year preceding such consolidation; and

(iii) took place on or after January 1, 1983.


(B) The population growth rate of all metropolitan cities referred to in section 5302(a)(12) of this title shall be based on the population of (i) metropolitan cities other than consolidated governments the grant for which is determined under this paragraph; and (ii) cities that were metropolitan cities before their incorporation into consolidated governments. For purposes of calculating the entitlement share for the balance of the consolidated government under this paragraph, the entire balance shall be considered to have been an urban county.



(c) Reallocation of undistributed funds within same metropolitan area as original allocation; amount and calculation of reallocation grant; disaster relief(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (4), any amounts allocated to a metropolitan city or an urban county pursuant to the preceding provisions of this section which are not received by the city or county for a fiscal year because of failure to meet the requirements of subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) of section 5304 of this title, or which become available as a result of actions under section 5304(e) or 5311 of this title, shall be reallocated in the succeeding fiscal year to the other metropolitan cities and urban counties in the same metropolitan area which certify to the satisfaction of the Secretary that they would be adversely affected by the loss of such amounts from the metropolitan area. The amount of the share of funds reallocated under this paragraph for any metropolitan city or urban county shall bear the same ratio to the total of such reallocated funds in the metropolitan area as the amount of funds awarded to the city or county for the fiscal year in which the reallocated funds become available bears to the total amount of funds awarded to all metropolitan cities and urban counties in the same metropolitan area for that fiscal year, except that—(A) in determining the amounts awarded to cities or counties for purposes of calculating shares pursuant to this sentence, there shall be excluded from the award of any city or county any amounts which become available as a result of actions against such city or county under section 5311 of this title;

(B) in reallocating amounts resulting from an action under section 5304(e) of this title or section 5311 of this title, a city or county against whom any such action was taken in a fiscal year shall be excluded from a calculation of share for purposes of reallocating, in the succeeding year, the amounts becoming available as a result of such action; and

(C) in no event may the share of reallocated funds for any metropolitan city or urban county exceed 25 per centum of the amount awarded to the city or county under subsection (b) of this section for the fiscal year in which the reallocated funds under this paragraph become available.


Any amounts allocated under subsection (b) of this section which become available for reallocation and for which no metropolitan city or urban county qualifies under this paragraph shall be added to amounts available for allocation under such subsection (b) of this section in the succeeding fiscal year.

(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary shall make grants from amounts authorized for use under subsection (b) of this section by the Department of Housing and Urban Development—Independent Agencies Appropriation Act, 1981, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter which governed grants with respect to such amounts, as such provisions existed prior to October 1, 1981, except that any such amounts which are not obligated before January 1, 1982, shall be reallocated in accordance with paragraph (1).

(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), the Secretary may upon request transfer responsibility to any metropolitan city for the administration of any amounts received, but not obligated, by the urban county in which such city is located if (A) such city was an included unit of general local government in such county prior to the qualification of such city as a metropolitan city; (B) such amounts were designated and received by such county for use in such city prior to the qualification of such city as a metropolitan city; and (C) such city and county agree to such transfer of responsibility for the administration of such amounts.

(4)(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), in the event of a major disaster declared by the President under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act [42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.], the Secretary shall make available, to metropolitan cities and urban counties located or partially located in the areas affected by the disaster, any amounts that become available as a result of actions under section 5304(e) or 5311 of this title.

(B) In using any amounts that become available as a result of actions under section 5304(e) or 5311 of this title, the Secretary shall give priority to providing emergency assistance under this paragraph.

(C) The Secretary may provide assistance to any metropolitan city or urban county under this paragraph only to the extent necessary to meet emergency community development needs, as the Secretary shall determine (subject to subparagraph (D)), of the city or county resulting from the disaster that are not met with amounts otherwise provided under this chapter, the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act [42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.], and other sources of assistance.

(D) Amounts provided to metropolitan cities and urban counties under this paragraph may be used only for eligible activities under section 5305 of this title, and in implementing this section, the Secretary shall evaluate the natural hazards to which any permanent replacement housing is exposed and shall take appropriate action to mitigate such hazards.

(E) The Secretary shall provide for applications (or amended applications and statements under section 5304 of this title) for assistance under this paragraph.

(F) A metropolitan city or urban county eligible for assistance under this paragraph may receive such assistance only in each of the fiscal years ending during the 3-year period beginning on the date of the declaration of the disaster by the President.

(G) This paragraph may not be construed to require the Secretary to reserve any amounts that become available as a result of actions under section 5304(e) or 5311 of this title for assistance under this paragraph if, when such amounts are to be reallocated under paragraph (1), no metropolitan city or urban county qualifies for assistance under this paragraph.



(d) Allocation among States for nonentitlement areas; amount and calculation of grants; distributions by State or Secretary; certain distributions made pursuant to prior provisions; certifications required by Governor enumerated; responsibility for administration and administrative expenses; reallocation; certifications required of units of general local government in nonentitlement areas; applicability of this chapter and other law(1) Of the amount approved in an appropriation Act under section 5303 of this title that remains after allocations pursuant to paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subsection (a) of this section, 30 per centum shall be allocated among the States for use in nonentitlement areas. The allocation for each State shall be the greater of an amount that bears the same ratio to the allocation for such areas of all States available under this subparagraph as either—(A) the average of the ratios between—(i) the population of the nonentitlement areas in that State and the population of the nonentitlement areas of all States;

(ii) the extent of poverty in the nonenti­tlement areas in that State and the extent of poverty in the nonentitlement areas of all States; and

(iii) the extent of housing overcrowding in the nonentitlement areas in that State and the extent of housing overcrowding in the nonentitlement areas of all States; or


(B) the average of the ratios between—(i) the age of housing in the nonentitlement areas in that State and the age of housing in the nonentitlement areas of all States;

(ii) the extent of poverty in the nonenti­tlement areas in that States and the extent of poverty in the nonentitlement areas of all States; and

(iii) the population of the nonentitlement areas in that State and the population of the nonentitlement areas of all States.



In determining the average of the ratios under subparagraph (A) the ratio involving the extent of poverty shall be counted twice and each of the other ratios shall be counted once; and in determining the average of the ratios under subparagraph (B), the ratio involving the age of housing shall be counted two and one-half times, the ratio involving the extent of poverty shall be counted one and one-half times, and the ratio involving population shall be counted once. The Secretary shall, in order to compensate for the discrepancy between the total of the amounts to be allocated under this paragraph and the total of the amounts available under such paragraph, make a pro rata reduction of each amount allocated to the nonenti­tlement areas in each State under such paragraph so that the nonentitlement areas in each State will receive an amount which represents the same percentage of the total amount available under such paragraph as the percentage which the nonentitlement areas of the same State would have received under such paragraph if the total amount available under such paragraph had equaled the total amount which was allocated under such paragraph.

(2)(A) Amounts allocated under paragraph (1) shall be distributed to units of general local government located in nonentitlement areas of the State to carry out activities in accordance with the provisions of this chapter—(i) by a State that has elected, in such manner and at such time as the Secretary shall prescribe, to distribute such amounts, consistent with the statement submitted under section 5304(a) of this title; or

(ii) by the Secretary, in any case described in subparagraph (B), for use by units of general local government in accordance with paragraph (3)(B).


Any election to distribute funds made after the close of fiscal year 1984 is permanent and final. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, the Secretary shall make grants from amounts authorized for use in nonentitlement areas by the Department of Housing and Urban Development—Independent Agencies Appropriation Act, 1981, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter which governed grants with respect to such amounts, as such provisions existed prior to October 1, 1981. Any amounts under the preceding sentence (except amounts for which preapplications have been approved by the Secretary prior to October 1, 1981, and which have been obligated by January 1, 1982) which are or become available for obligation after fiscal year 1981 shall be available for distribution in the State in which the grants from such amounts were made, by the State or by the Secretary, whichever is distributing the State allocation in the fiscal year in which such amounts are or become available.

(B) The Secretary shall distribute amounts allocated under paragraph (1) if the State has not elected to distribute such amounts.

(C) To receive and distribute amounts allocated under paragraph (1), the State must certify that it, with respect to units of general local government in nonentitlement areas—(i) engages or will engage in planning for community development activities;

(ii) provides or will provide technical assistance to units of general local government in connection with community development programs;

(iii) will not refuse to distribute such amounts to any unit of general local government on the basis of the particular eligible activity selected by such unit of general local government to meet its community development needs, except that this clause may not be considered to prevent a State from establishing priorities in distributing such amounts on the basis of the activities selected; and

(iv) has consulted with local elected officials from among units of general local government located in nonentitlement areas of that State in determining the method of distribution of funds required by subparagraph (A).


(D) To receive and distribute amounts allocated under paragraph (1), the State shall certify that each unit of general local government to be distributed funds will be required to identify its community development and housing needs, including the needs of low and moderate income persons, and the activities to be undertaken to meet such needs.


(3)(A) If the State receives and distributes such amounts, it shall be responsible for the administration of funds so distributed. The State shall pay from its own resources all administrative expenses incurred by the State in carrying out its responsibilities under this chapter or section 1437o(e)(1) 11 See References in Text note below. of this title, except that from the amounts received for distribution in nonentitlement areas, the State may deduct an amount to cover such expenses and its administrative expenses under section 1706e 1 of title 12 not to exceed the sum of $100,000 plus 50 percent of any such expenses under this chapter in excess of $100,000. Amounts deducted in excess of $100,000 shall not, subject to paragraph (6), exceed 3 percent of the amount so received.

(B) If the Secretary distributes such amounts, the distribution shall be made in accordance with determinations of the Secretary pursuant to statements submitted and the other requirements of section 5304 of this title (other than subsection (c)) and in accordance with regulations and procedures prescribed by the Secretary.

(C) Any amounts allocated for use in a State under paragraph (1) that are not received by the State for any fiscal year because of failure to meet the requirements of subsection (a), (b), or (d) of section 5304 of this title or to make the certifications required in subparagraphs (C) and (D) of paragraph (2), or that become available as a result of actions against the State under section 5304(e) or 5311 of this title, shall be added to amounts allocated to all States under paragraph (1) for the succeeding fiscal year.

(D) Any amounts allocated for use in a State under paragraph (1) that become available as a result of actions under section 5304(e) or 5311 of this title against units of general local government in nonentitlement areas of the State or as a result of the closeout of a grant made by the Secretary under this section in nonentitlement areas of the State shall be added to amounts allocated to the State under paragraph (1) for the fiscal year in which the amounts become so available.


(4) Any combination of units of general local governments may not be required to obtain recognition by the Secretary pursuant to section 5302(a)(1) of this title to be treated as a single unit of general local government for purposes of this subsection.

(5) From the amounts received under paragraph (1) for distribution in nonentitlement areas, the State may deduct an amount, subject to paragraph (6), not to exceed 3 percent of the amount so received, to provide technical assistance to local governments and nonprofit program recipients.

(6) Of the amounts received under paragraph (1), the State may deduct not more than an aggregate total of 3 percent of such amounts for—(A) administrative expenses under paragraph (3)(A); and

(B) technical assistance under paragraph (5).


(7) No amount may be distributed by any State or the Secretary under this subsection to any unit of general local government located in a nonentitlement area unless such unit of general local government certifies that—(A) it will minimize displacement of persons as a result of activities assisted with such amounts;

(B) its program will be conducted and administered in conformity with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.] and the Fair Housing Act [42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.], and that it will affirmatively further fair housing;

(C) it will provide for opportunities for citizen participation, hearings, and access to information with respect to its community development program that are comparable to those required of grantees under section 5304(a)(2) of this title; and

(D) it will not attempt to recover any capital costs of public improvements assisted in whole or part under this section or with amounts resulting from a guarantee under section 5308 of this title by assessing any amount against properties owned and occupied by persons of low and moderate income, including any fee charged or assessment made as a condition of obtaining access to such public improvements, unless (i) funds received under this section are used to pay the proportion of such fee or assessment that relates to the capital costs of such public improvements that are financed from revenue sources other than under this chapter; or (ii) for purposes of assessing any amount against properties owned and occupied by persons of moderate income, the grantee certifies to the Secretary or such State, as the case may be, that it lacks sufficient funds received under this section to comply with the requirements of clause (i).


(8) Any activities conducted with amounts received by a unit of general local government under this subsection shall be subject to the applicable provisions of this chapter and other Federal law in the same manner and to the same extent as activities conducted with amounts received by a unit of general local government under subsection (a) of this section.


(e) Qualification or submission dates, and finality and conclusiveness of computations and determinationsThe Secretary may fix such qualification or submission dates as he determines are necessary to permit the computations and determinations required by this section to be made in a timely manner, and all such computations and determinations shall be final and conclusive.


(f) Pro rata adjustment of entitlement amountsIf the total amount available for distribution in any fiscal year to metropolitan cities and urban counties under this section is insufficient to provide the amounts to which metropolitan cities and urban counties would be entitled under subsection (b) of this section, and funds are not otherwise appropriated to meet the deficiency, the Secretary shall meet the deficiency through a pro rata reduction of all amounts determined under subsection (b) of this section. If the total amount available for distribution in any fiscal year to metropolitan cities and urban counties under this section exceeds the amounts to which metropolitan cities and urban counties would be entitled under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall distribute the excess through a pro rata increase of all amounts determined under subsection (b) of this section.
