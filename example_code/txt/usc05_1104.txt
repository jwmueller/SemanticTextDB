The Office of Personnel Management shall notify the Secretary of Health and Human Services if a hospital is found to knowingly and willfully violate this subsection on a repeated basis and the Secretary may invoke appropriate sanctions in accordance with section 1866(b)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395cc(b)(2)) and applicable regulations.

(ii) Physicians and suppliers who have in force participation agreements with the Secretary of Health and Human Services consistent with section 1842(h)(1) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395u(h)(1)), whereby the participating provider accepts Medicare benefits (including allowable deductible and coinsurance amounts) as full payment for covered items and services shall accept equivalent benefit and enrollee cost-sharing under this chapter as full payment for services described in clause (i).
