(b) System functionsThe National Integrated Drought Information System shall—(1) provide an effective drought early warning system that—(A) collects and integrates information on the key indicators of drought and drought impacts in order to make usable, reliable, and timely forecasts of drought, including assessments of the severity of drought conditions and impacts; and

(B) provides such information, forecasts, and assessments on both national and regional levels;

(3) provide timely data, information, and products that reflect local, regional, and State differences in drought conditions;

(4) coordinate, and integrate as practicable, Federal research and monitoring in support of a drought early warning system;

(5) build upon existing forecasting and assessment programs and partnerships, including through the designation of one or more cooperative institutes to assist with National Integrated Drought Information System functions; and

(6) continue ongoing research and monitoring activities related to drought, including research activities relating to length, severity, and impacts of drought and the role of extreme weather events and climate variability in drought.
