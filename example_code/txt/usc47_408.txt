References in TextSection 615b of this title, referred to in subsec. (b), was in the original a reference to section 6 of the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999, Pub. L. 106–81, and was translated as if it had been a reference to section 7 of Pub. L. 106–81, which is classified to section 615b of this title, to reflect the probable intent of Congress and the renumbering of section 6 of Pub. L. 106–81 as section 7 by Pub. L. 110–283, title I, § 101(1), July 23, 2008, 122 Stat. 2620. Pub. L. 110–283, title I, § 101(3), July 23, 2008, 122 Stat. 2620 enacted a new section 6 of the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999 which is classified to section 215a–1 of this title, but that section does not contain definitions.
