§ 7217. Maintenance of effort(a) In generalExcept as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a State educational agency is entitled to receive its full allotment of funds under this part for any fiscal year only if the Secretary determines that either the combined fiscal effort per student or the aggregate expenditures within the State, with respect to the provision of free public education for the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made, was not less than 90 percent of such combined fiscal effort or aggregate expenditures for the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made.


(b) Reduction of fundsThe Secretary shall reduce the amount of the allotment of funds under this part in any fiscal year in the exact proportion by which the State educational agency fails to meet the requirements of subsection (a) of this section by falling below 90 percent of the fiscal effort per student or aggregate expenditures (using the measure most favorable to the State educational agency), and no such lesser amount shall be used for computing the effort or expenditures required under paragraph (1) for subsequent years.


(c) WaiverThe Secretary may waive, for 1 fiscal year only, the requirements of this section, if the Secretary determines that such a waiver would be equitable due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances, such as a natural disaster or a precipitous and unforeseen decline in the financial resources of the State educational agency.
