Historical and Revision Notes
1948 ActBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 407a (June 24, 1936, ch. 746, 49 Stat. 1899; June 29, 1938, ch. 813, 52 Stat. 1242).
Language designating offense as felony was omitted in uniformity with definitive section 1 of this title. (See reviser’s note under section 550 of this title.)
Words “and shall, upon conviction” were omitted as surplusage since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.
Reference to persons aiding, abetting or causing was omitted as such persons are made principals by section 2 of this title.
Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement, but without change of substance.

1949 ActThis section [section 30] corrects a typographical error in section 1231 of title 18, U.S.C.
