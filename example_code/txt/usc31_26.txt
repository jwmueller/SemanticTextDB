328(b)31:1014(last sentence).


In subsection (a), the words “director of a disbursing center” are substituted for “any regional disbursing officer of the Fiscal Service, Treasury Department” to reflect the title of the position now presently authorized. The words “dies, resigns, or leaves office” are substituted for “In case of the death or of the resignation or separation from office” for consistency with other titles of the United States Code. The words “designated by an official of the Treasury Department authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury to make such designation” are omitted as unnecessary because of the source provisions restated in section 321 of the revised title. The word “through” is substituted for “for a period of time not to extend beyond” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “as provided by law” are substituted for “in the General Accounting Office”, for consistency with other titles of the Code. The word “Secretary” is substituted for “Treasurer of the United States” because of the source provisions restated in section 321 of the revised title.
Subsection (b) is substituted for 31:1014(last sentence) for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.
