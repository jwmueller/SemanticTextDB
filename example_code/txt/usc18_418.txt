Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 46 of title 23, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Highways (June 19, 1922, ch. 227, § 4, par. 6, 42 Stat. 661).
Words “highway, or related,” were inserted before “project” in two places for the purpose of description, in view of transfer from title 23.
Words “upon conviction thereof” were omitted as surplusage, because punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.
Changes in phraseology were made.
