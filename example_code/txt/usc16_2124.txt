§ 460vv–5. Adjacent management
Congress does not intend that designation of wilderness areas in the State of Oklahoma lead to the creation of protective perimeters or buffer zones around each wilderness area. The fact that nonwilderness activities or uses can be seen or heard from areas within the wilderness shall not, of itself, preclude such activities or uses up to the boundary of the wilderness area.
(Pub. L. 100–499, § 7, Oct. 18, 1988, 102 Stat. 2494.)
