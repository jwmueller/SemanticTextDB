“SEC. 586F. DECLARATIONS REGARDING IRAQ’S LONG-STANDING VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.“(a) Iraq’s Violations of International Law.—The Congress determines that—“(1) the Government of Iraq has demonstrated repeated and blatant disregard for its obligations under international law by violating the Charter of the United Nations, the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare (done at Geneva, June 17, 1925), as well as other international treaties;

“(2) the Government of Iraq is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights and is obligated under the Covenants, as well as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to respect internationally recognized human rights;

“(3) the State Department’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1989 again characterizes Iraq’s human rights record as ‘abysmal’;

“(4) Amnesty International, Middle East Watch, and other independent human rights organizations have documented extensive, systematic, and continuing human rights abuses by the Government of Iraq, including summary executions, mass political killings, disappearances, widespread use of torture, arbitrary arrests and prolonged detention without trial of thousands of political opponents, forced relocation and deportation, denial of nearly all civil and political rights such as freedom of association, assembly, speech, and the press, and the imprisonment, torture, and execution of children;

“(5) since 1987, the Government of Iraq has intensified its severe repression of the Kurdish minority of Iraq, deliberately destroyed more than 3,000 villages and towns in the Kurdish regions, and forcibly expelled more than 500,000 people, thus effectively depopulating the rural areas of Iraqi Kurdistan;

“(6) Iraq has blatantly violated international law by initiating use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war;

“(7) Iraq has also violated international law by using chemical weapons against its own Kurdish citizens, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and more than 65,000 refugees;

“(8) Iraq continues to expand its chemical weapons capability, and President Saddam Hussein has threatened to use chemical weapons against other nations;

“(9) persuasive evidence exists that Iraq is developing biological weapons in violation of international law;

“(10) there are strong indications that Iraq has taken steps to produce nuclear weapons and has attempted to smuggle from the United States, in violation of United States law, components for triggering devices used in nuclear warheads whose manufacture would contravene the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to which Iraq is a party; and

“(11) Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has threatened to use terrorism against other nations in violation of international law and has increased Iraq’s support for the Palestine Liberation Organization and other Palestinian groups that have conducted terrorist acts.


“(b) Human Rights Violations.—The Congress determines that the Government of Iraq is engaged in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights. All provisions of law that impose sanctions against a country whose government is engaged in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights shall be fully enforced against Iraq.

“(c) Support for International Terrorism.—(1) The Congress determines that Iraq is a country which has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, a country which grants sanctuary from prosecution to individuals or groups which have committed an act of international terrorism, and a country which otherwise supports international terrorism. The provisions of law specified in paragraph (2) and all other provisions of law that impose sanctions against a country which has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, which grants sanctuary from prosecution to an individual or group which has committed an act of international terrorism, or which otherwise supports international terrorism shall be fully enforced against Iraq.

“(2) The provisions of law referred to in paragraph (1) are—“(A) section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2780];

“(B) section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2371];

“(C) sections 555 and 556 of this Act [104 Stat. 2021, 2022] (and the corresponding sections of predecessor foreign operations appropriations Acts); and

“(D) section 555 of the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985 [99 Stat. 227].



“(d) Multilateral Cooperation.—The Congress calls on the President to seek multilateral cooperation—“(1) to deny dangerous technologies to Iraq;
