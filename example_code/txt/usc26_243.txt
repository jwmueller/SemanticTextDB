Such amortizable basis at the end of the month shall be computed without regard to the amortization deduction for such month. The 84-month period shall begin on the first day of the first month of the second half of the taxable year in which the amortizable basis is acquired.

The reforestation expenditures so treated shall be allowed as a deduction.


(B) Dollar limitationThe aggregate amount of reforestation expenditures which may be taken into account under subparagraph (A) with respect to each qualified timber property for any taxable year shall not exceed—(i) except as provided in clause (ii) or (iii), $10,000,

For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “controlled group” has the meaning assigned to it by section 1563(a), except that the phrase “more than 50 percent” shall be substituted for the phrase “at least 80 percent” each place it appears in section 1563(a)(1).

(B) Partnerships and S corporationsIn the case of a partnership, the dollar limitation contained in paragraph (1)(B) shall apply with respect to the partnership and with respect to each partner. A similar rule shall apply in the case of an S corporation and its shareholders.
