â€œSec. 7. [Suits against corporation before dissolution; United States as party]. No suit, action, or other proceeding lawfully commenced by or against Federal Facilities Corporation before the dissolution of the Corporation shall abate by reason of such dissolution; but the court may, on motion or supplemental petition filed at any time within twelve months after such dissolution and showing a necessity for the survival of such suit, action, or other proceeding to obtain a settlement of the questions involved, allow the same to be maintained by or against the United States in such court. After the dissolution of the Corporation, any suit, action, or other proceeding which, but for such dissolution, would be commenced by or against the Corporation, shall be commenced by or against the United States in a Federal court of competent jurisdiction.
