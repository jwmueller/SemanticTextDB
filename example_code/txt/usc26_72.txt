§ 45Q. Credit for carbon dioxide sequestration(a) General ruleFor purposes of section 38, the carbon dioxide sequestration credit for any taxable year is an amount equal to the sum of—(1) $20 per metric ton of qualified carbon dioxide which is—(A) captured by the taxpayer at a qualified facility, and

(B) disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage and not used by the taxpayer as described in paragraph (2)(B), and


(2) $10 per metric ton of qualified carbon dioxide which is—(A) captured by the taxpayer at a qualified facility,

(B) used by the taxpayer as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project, and

(C) disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage.



(b) Qualified carbon dioxideFor purposes of this section—(1) In generalThe term “qualified carbon dioxide” means carbon dioxide captured from an industrial source which—(A) would otherwise be released into the atmosphere as industrial emission of greenhouse gas, and

(B) is measured at the source of capture and verified at the point of disposal or injection.


(2) Recycled carbon dioxideThe term “qualified carbon dioxide” includes the initial deposit of captured carbon dioxide used as a tertiary injectant. Such term does not include carbon dioxide that is re-captured, recycled, and re-injected as part of the enhanced oil and natural gas recovery process.



(c) Qualified facilityFor purposes of this section, the term “qualified facility” means any industrial facility—(1) which is owned by the taxpayer,

(2) at which carbon capture equipment is placed in service, and

(3) which captures not less than 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide during the taxable year.


(d) Special rules and other definitionsFor purposes of this section—(1) Only carbon dioxide captured and disposed of or used within the United States taken into accountThe credit under this section shall apply only with respect to qualified carbon dioxide the capture and disposal or use of which is within—(A) the United States (within the meaning of section 638(1)), or

(B) a possession of the United States (within the meaning of section 638(2)).


(2) Secure geological storageThe Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency 11 So in original. A comma probably should appear. the Secretary of Energy, and the Secretary of the Interior,,22 So in original. shall establish regulations for determining adequate security measures for the geological storage of carbon dioxide under paragraph (1)(B) or (2)(C) of subsection (a) such that the carbon dioxide does not escape into the atmosphere. Such term shall include storage at deep saline formations, oil and gas reservoirs, and unminable coal seams under such conditions as the Secretary may determine under such regulations.


(3) Tertiary injectantThe term “tertiary injectant” has the same meaning as when used within section 193(b)(1).


(4) Qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery projectThe term “qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project” has the meaning given the term “qualified enhanced oil recovery project” by section 43(c)(2), by substituting “crude oil or natural gas” for “crude oil” in subparagraph (A)(i) thereof.


(5) Credit attributable to taxpayerAny credit under this section shall be attributable to the person that captures and physically or contractually ensures the disposal of or the use as a tertiary injectant of the qualified carbon dioxide, except to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary.


(6) RecaptureThe Secretary shall, by regulations, provide for recapturing the benefit of any credit allowable under subsection (a) with respect to any qualified carbon dioxide which ceases to be captured, disposed of, or used as a tertiary injectant in a manner consistent with the requirements of this section.


(7) Inflation adjustmentIn the case of any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2009, there shall be substituted for each dollar amount contained in subsection (a) an amount equal to the product of—(A) such dollar amount, multiplied by
