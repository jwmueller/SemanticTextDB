â€œSec. 4. The Study Group shall undertake, subject to oversight and review by the Interagency Committee, such studies and other activities as it considers necessary and appropriate to determine the technical and commercial feasibility, economic impact, and other consequences of developing cigarettes and little cigars that will have a minimum propensity to ignite upholstered furniture or mattresses. Such activities include identification of the different physical characteristics of cigarettes and little cigars which have an impact on the ignition of upholstered furniture and mattresses, an analysis of the feasibility of altering any pertinent characteristics to reduce ignition propensity, and an analysis of the possible costs and benefits, both to the industry and the public, associated with any such product modification.
