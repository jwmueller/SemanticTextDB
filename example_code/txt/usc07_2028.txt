§ 3701. Congressional findings and declarations
Congress finds and declares that—(1) an adequate system for the efficient transient storage and movement of bulk agricultural commodities is essential to the overall success of the agricultural industry of the Nation, the development of rural areas of the Nation, and the economic stability of the Nation;

(2) the movement and storage of bulk agricultural commodities has been seriously and repeatedly impeded by shortages of transient storage facilities, adequate rail rolling stock, and the deterioration of many railroad track beds and rural highways throughout the United States;

(3) the efficient movement and storage of bulk agricultural commodities may be achieved and facilitated by the joint location at strategic points throughout the United States of transient storage facilities and multimodal terminal facilities constructed especially for the efficient shipment and receipt of agricultural commodities; and

(4) the location of such facilities must be carefully planned to assure maximum benefits to producers of agricultural commodities and unprocessed agricultural products and utilization of the most efficient means of transporting bulk agricultural commodities for domestic and export markets.
