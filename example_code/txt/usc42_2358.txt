(b), designated third sentence as subsec. (c) and substituted “The State educational agency may” for “Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed to limit the ability of the State educational agency to”, struck out fourth and fifth sentences, designated sixth sentence as subsec. (d) and substituted “Use of funds paid to States” for “Such food costs”, and designated seventh to ninth sentences as subsecs. (e) to (g), respectively. Prior to amendment, fourth and fifth sentences read as follows: “Such disbursement to any school shall be made only for the purpose of assisting it to obtain agricultural commodities and other foods for consumption by children in the school lunch program. The terms ‘child’ and ‘children’ as used in this chapter shall be deemed to include individuals regardless of age who are determined by the State educational agency, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to have 1 or more mental or physical handicaps and who are attending any child care institution as defined in section 1766 of this title or any nonresidential public or nonprofit private school of high school grade or under for the purpose of participating in a school program established for individuals with mental or physical handicaps: Provided, That no institution that is not otherwise eligible to participate in the program under section 1766 of this title shall be deemed so eligible because of this sentence.”

(d) by substituting “individuals” for “persons”, “to have 1 or more mental or physical handicaps” for “to be mentally or physically handicapped”, and “for individuals with mental or physical handicaps” for “for mentally or physically handicapped”, was executed by making the substitutions in the undesignated text before the proviso as the probable intent of Congress because the section contains no subsection designations.

Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed to limit the ability of the State educational agency to suspend or terminate any such agreement in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.”
