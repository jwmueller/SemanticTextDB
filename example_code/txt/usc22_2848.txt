(c) Grant agreementAny grant agreement or grants under this section shall be subject to the following limitations and restrictions:(1) The Board may not make any grant to Radio Free Asia unless the headquarters of Radio Free Asia and its senior administrative and managerial staff are in a location which ensures economy, operational effectiveness, and accountability to the Board.

FindingsPub. L. 111–202, § 1, July 13, 2010, 124 Stat. 1373, provided that: 
“Congress finds the following:
“(1) Radio Free Asia (referred to in this Act [amending this section] as ‘RFA’)—“(A) was authorized under section 309 of the United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994 (22 U.S.C. 6208);

“(B) was incorporated as a private, non-profit corporation in March 1996 in the hope that its operations would soon be obviated by the global advancement of democracy; and

“(C) is headquartered in Washington, DC, with additional offices in Bangkok, Hong Kong, Phnom Penh, Seoul, Ankara, and Taipei.


“(2) RFA broadcasts serve as substitutes for indigenous free media in regions lacking free media outlets.

“(3) The mission of RFA is ‘to provide accurate and timely news and information to Asian countries whose governments prohibit access to a free press’ in order to enable informed decisionmaking by the people within Asia.

“(4) RFA provides daily broadcasts of news, commentary, analysis, and cultural programming to Asian countries in several languages, including—“(A) 12 hours per day in Mandarin;

“(B) 8 hours per day in 3 Tibetan dialects, Uke, Kham, and Amdo;

“(C) 4 hours per day in Korean and Burmese;

“(D) 2 hours per day in Cantonese, Vietnamese, Laotian, Khmer (Cambodian), and Uyghur; and

“(E) 1½ hours per week in Wu (local Shanghai dialect).


“(5) The governments of the countries targeted for these broadcasts have consistently denied and blocked attempts at Medium Wave and FM transmissions into their countries, forcing RFA to rely on Shortwave broadcasts and the Internet.

“(6) RFA has provided continuous online news to its Asian audiences since 2004, although some countries—“(A) routinely and aggressively block RFA’s website;

“(B) monitor access to RFA’s website; and

“(C) discourage online users by making it illegal to access RFA’s website.


“(7) Despite these attempts, RFA has successfully managed to reach its online audiences through proxies, cutting-edge software, and active republication and repostings by its audience.

“(8) RFA also provides forums for local opinions and experiences through message boards, podcasts, web logs (blogs), cell phone-distributed newscasts, and new media, including Facebook, Flickr, Twitter, and YouTube.

“(9) Freedom House has documented that freedom of the press is in decline in nearly every region of the world, particularly in Asia, where none of the countries served by RFA have increased their freedom of the press during the past 5 years.

“(10) In fiscal year 2010, RFA is operating on a $37,000,000 budget, less than $400,000 of which is available to fund Internet censorship circumvention.

“(11) Congress currently provides grant funding for RFA’s operations on a fiscal year basis.”
