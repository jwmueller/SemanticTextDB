Codification
When originally enacted, section 5 of act June 22, 1936, which consisted of a paragraph (including a proviso) authorizing works of improvement followed by numerous headings and paragraphs describing those authorized works, was not classified to the Code. Act July 19, 1937, amended section 5 of act June 22, 1936, by inserting two additional provisos at the end of the first paragraph. The provisos inserted by the 1937 Act, as amended, form the sole basis for the text appearing in this section, with minor editorial changes to the introductory language of the provisos. Subsequent amendments to section 5 of act June 22, 1936, have generally been directed to the text of section 5 as it has appeared in the Code and have not taken into account the portion of that section that has never been set out. Those amendments have been executed as directed, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, and amendment notes below reflect such execution without further comment.

L. 112–74 substituted “water resources development study or project” for “flood control or environmental restoration work” and inserted “for work, which includes planning and design,” before “to be expended” and “: Provided further, That the term ‘States’ means the several States, the District of Columbia, the commonwealths, territories, and possessions of the United States, and Federally recognized Indian tribes” before period at end.
