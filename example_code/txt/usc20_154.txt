“SEC. 2. FINDINGS.“The Congress finds the following:“(1) Native Americans across the Nation—Indians, Native Alaskans, and Native Hawaiians—have a long, proud and distinguished tradition of service in the Armed Forces of the United States.

“(2) Native Americans have historically served in the Armed Forces of the United States in numbers which far exceed their representation in the population of the United States.

“(3) Native American veterans count among themselves a number of Medal of Honor recipients. Their numbers are also conspicuous in the ranks of those who have received other decorations for valor and distinguished service.

“(4) Native Americans have lost their lives in the service of their Nation and in the cause of peace.

“(5) The National Museum of the American Indian was established as a living memorial to Native Americans. Its mission is to advance knowledge and understanding of Native American cultures, including art, history, language, and the contributions Native Americans have made to our society.

“(6) The National Museum of the American Indian is an extraordinary site and an ideal location to establish a National Native American Veterans’ Memorial.

“(7) A National Native American Veterans’ Memorial would further the purposes of the National Museum of the American Indian by giving all Americans the opportunity to learn of the proud and courageous tradition of service of Native Americans in the Armed Forces of the United States.
