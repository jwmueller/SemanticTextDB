Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 593 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking (Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, § 22, 38 Stat. 272; Sept. 26, 1918, ch. 177, § 5, 40 Stat. 970; Feb. 25, 1927, ch. 191, § 15, 44 Stat. 1232; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, § 326(a), 49 Stat. 715).
Other provisions of section 593 of title 12, U.S.C. 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, are incorporated in sections 217 and 218 of this title.
The words “and shall upon conviction thereof” were omitted as unnecessary, since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.
The phrase “bank or banking institution which is a member of the Federal Reserve System or which is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation” was substituted for “member bank or insured bank” to avoid the use of a definitive section based on sections 221a, 264(e)(8), and 588a of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking. Words “banks the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation” were substituted for “insured banks” in second paragraph, for the same reason.
Punishment provision harmonized with that of section 656 of this title. (See also, reviser’s notes under sections 641 and 645 of this title.)
Changes in phraseology were also made.
