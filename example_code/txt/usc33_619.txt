Transfer of Functions
The officers or employees to be retired refer to the officers and employees of the Lighthouse Service.

Subsequently, the functions of the Secretary of the Treasury relating to the Coast Guard were transferred to the Secretary of Transportation by section 6(b)(1) of Pub. L. 89–670.
