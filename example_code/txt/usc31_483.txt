In the section, before clause (1), the words “to have another executive agency carry out or supervise” are substituted for “to other Federal agencies powers and functions relating to the supervision or administration” to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (1), the words “under conditions ensuring” are substituted for “only on such conditions as may be appropriate to assure”, the word “consistent” is substituted for “in full conformity”, and the word “law” is substituted for “applicable statutory provisions and policies”, to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (2), the words “for which the agency provides assistance” are substituted for “funded by their agencies”, for clarity because the source provisions do not provide for funding. The words “of Federal assistance”, “for other agencies to perform”, “such activities with respect to”, and “under this section” are omitted as unnecessary.
