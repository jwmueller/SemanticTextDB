(b) Costs Allowable as Indirect Expenses.—The regulations prescribed pursuant to subsection (a) shall provide that independent research and development and bid and proposal costs shall be allowable as indirect expenses on covered contracts to the extent that those costs are allocable, reasonable, and not otherwise unallowable by law or under the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

(c) Additional Controls.—Subject to subsection (f), the regulations prescribed pursuant to subsection (a) may include the following provisions:(1) A limitation on the allowability of independent research and development and bid and proposal costs to work which the Secretary of Defense determines is of potential interest to the Department of Defense.

(B) from contractors to the Department of Defense, in a reasonable manner, of information regarding progress by the contractor on the contractor’s independent research and development programs.



(d) Adjusted Maximum Reimbursement Amount.—For purposes of subsection (c)(2), the adjusted maximum reimbursement amount for a major contractor for a fiscal year is the sum of—(1) the total amount of the allowable independent research and development and bid and proposal costs incurred by the contractor during the preceding fiscal year;

(3) if the projected total amount of the independent research and development and bid and proposal costs incurred by the contractor for such fiscal year is greater than the total amount of the independent research and development and bid and proposal costs incurred by the contractor for the preceding fiscal year, the amount that is determined by multiplying the amount referred to in paragraph (1) by the lesser of—(A) the percentage by which the projected total amount of such incurred costs for such fiscal year exceeds the total amount of the incurred costs of the contractor for the preceding fiscal year; or

(2) is otherwise in the best interest of the Government.


(f) Limitations on Regulations.—Regulations prescribed pursuant to subsection (c) may not include provisions that would infringe on the independence of a contractor to choose which technologies to pursue in its independent research and development program.
