In subsection (a)(1), the exception for the President and Vice President is omitted as surplusage as these elected officers are not employed in or under an agency and thus are not included in the definition of “employee” in section 4101(2).
In subsection (a)(1)(C), the words “as defined by section 231(a) of Title 37” are omitted as unnecessary in view of the definition of “uniformed services” in section 2101(b).

In subsection (b)(1), reference to “section 21, and section 22” is omitted as unnecessary since the sections are not carried into this title, but are scheduled for repeal, see Table II.
