In clause (1), the words “full and complete reports and other” are omitted as surplus. In clause (2), the words “State aeronautical agency, or other” are omitted as surplus. The text of 49 App.:1324(b) (words after 3d comma) is omitted as surplus because of 49:322(c)(3). In clause (3), the words “government of a foreign country” are substituted for “foreign governments” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.
