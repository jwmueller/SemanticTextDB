Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 221 and 222, 544 and 546 and District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., § 11–204 (Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 517, § 2, 26 Stat. 826; Feb. 9, 1893, ch. 74, § 4, 27 Stat. 435; July 30, 1894, ch. 172, § 1, 28 Stat. 160; June 6, 1900, ch. 791, § 1, 31 Stat. 639; Mar. 3, 1901, ch. 854, § 224, 31 Stat. 1224; June 30, 1902, ch. 1329, 32 Stat. 528; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§ 124, 125, 36 Stat. 1132; Aug. 23, 1912, ch. 350, 37 Stat. 412; Feb. 22, 1921, ch. 70, § 7, 41 Stat. 1144; June 1, 1922, ch. 204, title II, 42 Stat. 616; Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 265, 42 Stat. 1488; May 21, 1928, ch. 659, 45 Stat. 645).
This section consolidates section 546 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with parts of sections 221, 222, and 544 of such title and a part of section 11–204 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed. Other provisions of such sections are incorporated in sections 604, 713, 954, 956, 961, and 962 of this title. Some provisions of section 11–204 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., were retained in that code. (See reviser’s note under section 604 of this title.)
Discrepancies between such section 11–204 of District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., and the more general provisions of title 28 were eliminated by adopting the more general provisions.
Words “Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts” were substituted for “Attorney General,” in view of the act of Aug. 7, 1939, ch. 501, § 6, 53 Stat. 1226, 28 U.S.C., 1940 ed., following § 446.
A provision that the returns should be filed annually was changed to place the times of accounting within the discretion of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, who has supervision over such accounts. (See section 604 of this title.)
This section is in harmony with section 671 of this title as to accounting similarly by the Clerk of the Supreme Court.
“Court of appeals” was substituted for “circuit court of appeals” to conform to section 43 of this title.
The provision that each clerk shall be removable by the court is new. Section 222 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., provided that deputies might be removed at the pleasure of the clerk, subject to the court’s approval, and there was no term of office specified for the clerk and no provision for his removal.
The words “and other necessary employees” were added in subsection (b) to supply an omission of existing law and to give statutory authority for the appointment of necessary employees for which compensation is annually appropriated.
Changes were made in phraseology.
