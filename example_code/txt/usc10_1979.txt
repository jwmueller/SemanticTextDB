(2) For purposes of this subsection, an unspecified minor military construction project is a military construction project that (notwithstanding subsection (a)) has an approved cost equal to or less than $4,000,000. The Secretary of Defense shall establish procedures for the review and approval of requests from the Secretary of a military department to carry out a construction project under this subsection.

(3) Not later than February 1, 2014, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report on the use of the authority provided by this subsection. The report shall include a list and description of the construction projects carried out under this subsection, including the location and cost of each project.
