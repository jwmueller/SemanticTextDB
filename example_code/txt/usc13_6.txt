Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., §§ 122, 215, 252, and section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., The Public Health and Welfare (June 18, 1929, ch. 28, § 15, 46 Stat. 25; June 19, 1948, ch. 502, § 2, 62 Stat. 479; July 15, 1949, ch. 338, title VI, § 607, 63 Stat. 441; Sept. 7, 1950, ch. 910, § 1, 64 Stat. 784).
Section consolidates section 215 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., with those parts of sections 122 and 252 of such title which respectively made such section 215 applicable to the quinquennial censuses of manufacturers and the mineral industries and other businesses, and governments, and with that part of subsection (b) of section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which made such section 215 applicable to the decennial censuses of housing (see subchapters I, II, and III of chapter 5 of this title). As originally enacted in 1929, such section 215 had related only to the decennial censuses of population, agriculture, etc., the provisions for which are continued in subchapter II of chapter 5 of this title.
The provisions, as revised in this section, relate, not only to the censuses referred to above, but also, to all other investigations provided for in this title. This was probably the Congressional intent.
Words in section 215 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., “on request of the Director of the Census”, were omitted since all functions under this title are vested primarily in the Secretary (of Commerce), in view of 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, §§ 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263. See Revision Note to section 4 of this title.
Changes were made in phraseology.
For remainder of sections 122 and 252 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., and of section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed. (which has been transferred in its entirety to this revised title), see Distribution Table.
