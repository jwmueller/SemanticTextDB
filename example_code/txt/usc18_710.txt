(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 792; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(J), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased upon section 124 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Judicial Code and Judiciary (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 65, 36 Stat. 1104).
Word “trustee” was inserted after “receiver” so as to make it clear that persons holding such office are included in the enumeration of court officers who are subject to the provisions of this section.
Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement, but without change of substance or meaning.
Other provisions of section 124 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were retained in that title.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $3,000”.
