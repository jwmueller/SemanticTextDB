“(3) Within one year after the date of enactment of this paragraph [Aug. 26, 1992], the Secretary, in direct consultation with the city of East St. Louis, Gateway Arch Park Expansion, and the Southwestern Illinois Development Authority, shall develop and transmit to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate and the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs [now Committee on Natural Resources] of the United States House of Representatives a study of alternatives to, and costs associated with, the removal of the grain elevator located within the East St. Louis unit of the Memorial. The study shall contain, but need not be limited to, at least one alternative which would incorporate and retain the existing grain elevator into the draft development and management plan and environmental assessment referred to in paragraph (1).
