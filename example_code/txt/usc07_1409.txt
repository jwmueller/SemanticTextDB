References in TextThis Act, referred to in subsec. (a), refers to the Agricultural Act of 1961, Pub. L. 87–128, Aug. 8, 1961, 75 Stat. 294, as amended. For classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 1911 of this title and Tables. However, the reference was probably intended to be “this title” meaning the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act, title III of Pub. L. 87–128, as amended, which is classified principally to this chapter. For classification of this title to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 1921 of this title and Tables.
