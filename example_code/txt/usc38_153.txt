“Sec. 5. (a) In carrying out the responsibilities of the Administrator of Veterans’ Affairs [now Secretary of Veterans Affairs] under section 1154(a)(2) [formerly 354(a)(2)] of title 38, United States Code, and in order to promote consistency in claims processing and decisions, the Administrator shall prescribe regulations to—“(1) establish guidelines and (where appropriate) standards and criteria for the resolution of claims for benefits under laws administered by the Veterans’ Administration [now Department of Veterans Affairs] where the criteria for eligibility for a benefit include a requirement that a death or disability be service connected and the claim of service connection is based on a veteran’s exposure during service in connection with such veteran’s participation in atmospheric nuclear tests or with the American occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, Japan, prior to July 1, 1946, to ionizing radiation from the detonation of a nuclear device; and

“(2) ensure that, with respect to those claims, the policy of the United States described in section 2(13) [set out above] is carried out.


“(b)(1)(A) The guidelines required to be established in regulations prescribed under this section shall include guidelines governing the evaluation of the findings of scientific studies relating to the possible increased risk of adverse health effects of exposure to ionizing radiation. Those guidelines shall require that, in the evaluation of those studies, the Administrator [now Secretary] shall take into account whether the results are statistically significant, are capable of replication, and withstand peer review.

“(B) The evaluations described in subparagraph (A) shall be made by the Administrator of Veterans’ Affairs [now Secretary of Veterans Affairs] after receiving the advice of the Scientific Council of the Veterans’ Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards (established under section 6). Those evaluations shall be published in the notice section of the Federal Register.

“(C) The standards and criteria required to be established in regulations prescribed under this section shall include provisions governing the use in the adjudication of individual claims of the Administrator’s [now Secretary’s] evaluations made under subparagraph (B).


“(2)(A)(i) In prescribing regulations under this section, the Administrator [now Secretary] (after receiving the advice of the Advisory Committee and of the Scientific Council of the Veterans’ Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards regarding the diseases described in subparagraph (B)) shall make determinations, based on sound medical and scientific evidence, with respect to each disease described in subparagraph (B) as to whether service connection shall, subject to division (ii) of this subparagraph, be granted in the adjudication of individual cases. In making determinations regarding such diseases, the Administrator shall give due regard to the need to maintain the policy of the United States with respect to the resolution of contested issues as set forth in section 2(13) [set out above]. The Administrator shall set forth in such regulations such determinations, with any specification (relating to exposure or other relevant matter) of limitations on the circumstances under which service connection shall be granted, and shall implement such determinations in accordance with such regulations.

“(ii) If the Administrator [now Secretary] makes a determination, pursuant to this subparagraph, that service connection shall be granted in the case of a disease described in subparagraph (B), the Administrator shall specify in such regulations that, in the adjudication of individual cases, service connection shall not be granted where there is sufficient affirmative evidence to the contrary or evidence to establish that an intercurrent injury or disease which is a recognized cause of the described disease has been suffered between the date of separation from service and the onset of such disease or that the disability is due to the veteran’s own willful misconduct.

“(iii) With regard to each disease described in subparagraph (B), the Administrator [now Secretary] shall include in the regulations prescribed under this section provisions specifying the factors to be considered in adjudicating issues relating to whether or not service connection should be granted in individual cases and the circumstances governing the granting of service connection for such disease.


“(B) The diseases referred to in subparagraph (A) are those specified in section 2(5) [set out above] and any other disease with respect to which the Administrator [now Secretary] finds (after receiving and considering the advice of the Scientific Council established under section 6(d)(2)) that there is sound scientific or medical evidence indicating a connection to exposure to ionizing radiation, in the case of a veteran who was exposed to ionizing radiation in connection with such veteran’s participation in an atmospheric nuclear test or with the American occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, Japan, before July 1, 1946.


“(3) The regulations prescribed under this section shall include—“(A) specification of the maximum period of time after exposure to such ionizing radiation for the development of those diseases; and

“(B) a requirement that a claimant filing a claim based upon a veteran’s exposure to ionizing radiation from the detonation of a nuclear device may not be required to produce evidence substantiating the veteran’s exposure during active military, naval, or air service if the information in the veteran’s service records and other records of the Department of Defense is not inconsistent with the claim that the veteran was present where and when the claimed exposure occurred.



“(c)(1) The Administrator of Veterans’ Affairs [now Secretary of Veterans Affairs] shall develop the regulations required by this section (and any amendment to those regulations) through a public review and comment process in accordance with the provisions of section 553 of title 5, United States Code. That process may include consideration by the Administrator of the recommendations of the Veterans’ Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards and the Scientific Council thereof (established under section 6) with respect to the proposed regulations, and that process shall include consideration by the Administrator of the recommendations of the Committee and the Council with respect to the final regulations and proposed and final amendments to such regulations. The period for public review and comment shall be completed not later than ninety days after the proposed regulations or proposed amendments are published in the Federal Register.

“(2)(A) Not later than one hundred and eighty days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 24, 1984], the Administrator [now Secretary] shall develop and publish in the Federal Register a proposed version of the regulations required to be prescribed by this section.

“(B) Not later than three hundred days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 24, 1984], the Administrator [now Secretary] shall publish in the Federal Register the final regulations (together with explanations of the bases for the guidelines, standards, and criteria contained therein) required to be prescribed by this section.
