The text of 41:506(a) is omitted as unnecessary because it duplicates the requirements of sections 6303–6305 of the revised title. The word “equipment” is omitted as being included in “tangible personal property”. The words “amounts provided under a contract, grant agreement, or cooperative agreement” are substituted for “such funds” for clarity. The words “decides the vesting” are substituted for “it is deemed” for clarity. The word “conditions” is substituted for “terms and conditions” because it is inclusive.
