Historical and Revision Notes


Revised sectionSource section (U.S. Code)


350346:369(b)


Section 3503 requires the use of fire retardant materials on a vessel having berthing facilities for at least 50 passengers. This requirement in the case of vessels engaged in foreign trade is consistent with our international treaty obligations, which impose extensive and additional fire safety standards. A waiver that grandfathers existing inland river passenger vessels is also included.

L. 104–324 substituted “Before November 1, 2008, this section does not apply to any vessel in operation before January 1, 1968, and operating only within the Boundary Line.” for “Before November 1, 1998, this section does not apply to a vessel in operation before January 1, 1968, and operating only on the inland rivers.”
1991—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 102–241, § 20(1), substituted “1998” for “1993”.
Subsec. (b)(1)(D). Pub. L. 102–241, § 20(2), added subpar. (D).
1986—Pub. L. 99–307 designated existing provision as subsec. (a), substituted “November 1, 1993” for “November 1, 1988” and inserted “in operation before January 1, 1968, and” after “to a vessel”, and added subsec. (b).
