§ 6292. Minors enlisted upon false statement of age(a) The Secretary of the Navy, under regulations prescribed by him, may discharge or release from the naval service, with pay and allowances and form of discharge certificate appropriate for his service after enlistment, any enlisted member who, as the result of a false statement of age on his application for enlistment, was enlisted while under the minimum statutory or administrative age limit. A member so discharged or released is entitled to transportation in kind and subsistence from the place of discharge to his home.

6292(a)34 U.S.C. 900a.Sept. 24, 1945, ch. 385, § 1, 59 Stat. 536.

The word “member” is substituted for the word “person” and the words “naval service” are substituted for the words “Navy, Marine Corps, and the Reserve components thereof”. The words “form of” are added for clarity. Reference to the date “September 24, 1945” is omitted as unnecessary. The words “is entitled to” are substituted for the words “shall be furnished” for uniformity. The decision of the Comptroller General of December 23, 1949 (B–91297), has not been overlooked. That decision, without passing on a case in which the point was involved, indicated that the transportation entitlement in 34 U.S.C. 900a might be impliedly repealed by the Career Compensation Act of 1949. The editors of the United States Code Annotated, apparently on the basis of this decision, have omitted 34 U.S.C.A. 900a from the 1954 pocket part. A conclusion that the section is repealed, however, defeats the specific purpose of the provision, which, as indicated in the legislative hearings, was to insure that underage dischargees would be transported home and not simply released at the place of discharge.
