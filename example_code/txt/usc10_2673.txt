625434 U.S.C. 359 (less proviso).Feb. 4, 1919, ch. 14, § 6 (less proviso), 40 Stat. 1056; renumbered § 8 and amended Aug. 7, 1942, ch. 551, § 1, 56 Stat. 744.


The words “the appropriations for the pay of the Navy or the Marine Corps, as appropriate”, are substituted for the words “the appropriation ‘Pay, subsistence, and transportation of naval personnel’ ”, to identify by a general description, rather than by the specific appropriation title, the appropriation authorized to be used. Specific appropriation titles vary from one appropriation act to the next. The permanent authority contained in 34 U.S.C. 359 for the Secretary of the Navy to use appropriations available for the pay of the Navy and the Marine Corps is not affected by a change in the titles of those appropriations nor is it affected by a specific authorization in an appropriation act to use, during the life of the act, a different type of appropriation.
