References in TextThe Public Health Service Act, referred to in subsec. (b)(3)(D), is act July 1, 1944, ch. 373, 58 Stat. 682, as amended, which is classified generally to chapter 6A (§ 201 et seq.) of this title. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 201 of this title and Tables.
Section 14(a) of the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987, referred to in subsec. (b)(3)(E), is section 14(a) of Pub. L. 100–93, which is set out below.
Section 1395w–104(e)(6) of this title, referred to in subsec. (b)(3)(E), was in the original “section 1860D–3(e)(6)”, and was translated as reading “section 1860D–4(e)(6)” to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because section 1860D–3, which is classified to section 1395w–103 of this title, does not contain a subsec. (e), and section 1395w–104(e)(6) relates to regulations.
