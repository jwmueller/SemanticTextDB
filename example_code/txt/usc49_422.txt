In subsection (b), the words “Not later than December 22, 1989” are substituted for “within 18 months after June 22, 1988” for clarity. The words “may extend the period to a date that is not later than 18 months after the regulations are prescribed and the orders are issued” are substituted for “may extend the deadline for compliance with such requirement, but in no event shall such deadline be extended past 18 months after such rules, regulations, orders, and standards are issued” to eliminate unnecessary words.
