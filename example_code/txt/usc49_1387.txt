The words “which has been or shall hereafter be made” and “for the defraying of expenses of” are omitted as surplus. The National Firearms Act referred to in the source provision has been repealed and replaced by chapter 53 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 5801 et seq.). A specific reference to chapter 53 is unnecessary because of the reference to the internal revenue laws.
