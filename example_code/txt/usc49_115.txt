(B) consistent with the public interest and this chapter, if a required safety level does not exist.


(2) A special permit issued under this section shall be effective for an initial period of not more than 2 years and may be renewed by the Secretary upon application for successive periods of not more than 4 years each or, in the case of a special permit relating to section 5112, for an additional period of not more than 2 years.


(b) Applications.—When applying for a special permit or renewal of a special permit under this section, the person must provide a safety analysis prescribed by the Secretary that justifies the special permit. The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register notice that an application for a special permit has been filed and shall give the public an opportunity to inspect the safety analysis and comment on the application. This subsection does not require the release of information protected by law from public disclosure.

(c) Applications To Be Dealt With Promptly.—The Secretary shall issue or renew the special permit for which an application was filed or deny such issuance or renewal within 180 days after the first day of the month following the date of the filing of such application, or the Secretary shall publish a statement in the Federal Register of the reason why the Secretary’s decision on the special permit is delayed, along with an estimate of the additional time necessary before the decision is made.

(d) Exclusions.—(1) The Secretary shall exclude, in any part, from this chapter and regulations prescribed under this chapter—(A) a public vessel (as defined in section 2101 of title 46);

(B) a vessel exempted under section 3702 of title 46 from chapter 37 of title 46; and

(B) transportation of a firearm or ammunition in commerce.



(e) Limitation on Authority.—Unless the Secretary decides that an emergency exists, a special permit or renewal granted under this section is the only way a person subject to this chapter may be granted a variance from this chapter.

(f) Incorporation Into Regulations.—(1) In general.—Not later than 1 year after the date on which a special permit has been in continuous effect for a 10-year period, the Secretary shall conduct a review and analysis of that special permit to determine whether it may be converted into the hazardous materials regulations.

(2) Factors.—In conducting the review and analysis under paragraph (1), the Secretary may consider—(A) the safety record for hazardous materials transported under the special permit;

(B) the application of a special permit;

(C) the suitability of provisions in the special permit for incorporation into the hazardous materials regulations; and

(D) rulemaking activity in related areas.


(3) Rulemaking.—After completing the review and analysis under paragraph (1) and after providing notice and opportunity for public comment, the Secretary shall either institute a rulemaking to incorporate the special permit into the hazardous materials regulations or publish in the Federal Register the Secretary’s justification for why the special permit is not appropriate for incorporation into the regulations.

In subsection (a)(1), before clause (A), the words “or renew” and “subject to the requirements of this chapter” are omitted as surplus. In clause (A), the words “at least equal to the safety level required under this chapter” are substituted for “which is equal to or exceeds that level of safety which would be required in the absence of such exemption” to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsection (a)(2), the words “issued or renewed” are omitted as surplus.
In subsection (b), the words “upon application” and “grant of such” are omitted as surplus.

Clauses (A) and (B) restate the exceptions provided by section 201 of that Act and by section 4417a of the Revised Statutes as subsequently amended. Clause (C) is substituted for “any other vessel regulated under such Act, to the extent of such regulation” because of the restatement.
In subsection (c)(2), before clause (A), the word “prescribed” is substituted for “issued” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.
