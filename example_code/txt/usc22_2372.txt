By the authority vested in me as President of the United States of America by Section 827 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 U.S.C. 4067), and in order to conform further the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability System, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. (a) Section 826(c) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 U.S.C. 4066(c)) is deemed to be amended by striking out the first sentence of paragraph (1) thereof, and inserting in lieu thereof the following sentence:
“(1) The first increase (if any) made under this section to an annuity which is payable from the Fund to a participant or to the surviving spouse of a deceased participant who dies in service shall be equal to the product (adjusted to the nearest ⅒ of 1 percent) of—“(a) ⅙ of the applicable percent change determined under Subsection (b) of this Section, multiplied by

“(b) the number of full months for which the annuity was payable from the Fund before the effective date of the increase (counting any portion of a month as a full month).”.




Sec. 2. Section 808(a) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 U.S.C. 4048(a)) is deemed to be amended by adding at the end thereof the following:

Sec. 3. The amendments to be deemed made by this Order shall take effect as of February 15, 1981.
