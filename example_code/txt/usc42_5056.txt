§ 6901a. Congressional findings: used oil recycling
The Congress finds and declares that—(1) used oil is a valuable source of increasingly scarce energy and materials;

(2) technology exists to re-refine, reprocess, reclaim, and otherwise recycle used oil;

(3) used oil constitutes a threat to public health and the environment when reused or disposed of improperly; and


that, therefore, it is in the national interest to recycle used oil in a manner which does not constitute a threat to public health and the environment and which conserves energy and materials.
(Pub. L. 96–463, § 2, Oct. 15, 1980, 94 Stat. 2055.)
