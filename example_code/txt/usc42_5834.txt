Each Secretary concerned shall consult with the other Secretary before making any determination under paragraph (2).

(b) Maximum sales priceThe sales price specified in a purchase agreement under this section may not exceed the estimated prevailing market price as of the date of delivery, as determined by the Secretary of Energy, unless the Secretary concerned determines that such sales price must exceed the estimated prevailing market price in order to ensure the production of biomass energy to achieve the purposes of this chapter.
