(2) after consultation with the Office, with respect to standards for general positions.


(b) Not more than 30 percent of the Senior Executive Service positions authorized under section 3133 of this title may at any time be filled by individuals who did not have 5 years of current continuous service in the civil service immediately preceding their initial appointment to the Senior Executive Service, unless the President certifies to the Congress that the limitation would hinder the efficiency of the Government.

Such provisions shall apply in lieu of the provisions which would otherwise apply—(A) to the extent provided under regulations prescribed by the Office, and

(B) so long as the appointee continues to serve under such Presidential appointment.


(2) An election under paragraph (1) may also be made by any career appointee who is appointed to a civilian position in the executive branch—(A) which is not in the Senior Executive Service; and

An election under this paragraph shall remain effective so long as the appointee continues to serve in the same position.


(d) Appointment or removal of a person to or from any Senior Executive Service position in an independent regulatory commission shall not be subject, directly or indirectly, to review or approval by any officer or entity within the Executive Office of the President.
