“SEC. 202. RULES OF ORIGIN.“(a) In General.—“(1) For purposes of implementing the tariff treatment contemplated under the Agreement, goods originate in the territory of a Party if—“(A) they are wholly obtained or produced in the territory of either Party or both Parties; or

“(B) they—“(i) have been transformed in the territory of either Party or both Parties so as to be subject to a change in tariff classification as described in the Annex rules or to such other requirements as the Annex rules may provide when no change in tariff classifications occurs, and

“(ii) meet the other conditions set out in the Annex.



“(2) A good shall not be considered to originate in the territory of a party [Party] under paragraph (1)(B) merely by virtue of having undergone—“(A) simple packaging or, except as expressly provided by the Annex rules, combining operations;

“(B) mere dilution with water or another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the good; or

“(C) any process or work in respect of which it is established, or in respect of which the facts as ascertained clearly justify the presumption, that the sole object was to circumvent the provisions of chapter 3 of the Agreement.


“(3) Accessories, spare parts, or tools delivered with any piece of equipment, machinery, apparatus, or vehicle that form part of its standard equipment shall be treated as having the same origin as that equipment, machinery, apparatus, or vehicle if the quantities and values of such accessories, spare parts, or tools are customary for the equipment, machinery, apparatus, or vehicle.


“(b) Transshipment.—Goods exported from the territory of one Party originate in the territory of that Party only if—“(1) the goods meet the applicable requirements of subsection (a) and are shipped to the territory of the other Party without having entered the commerce of any third country;

“(2) the goods, if shipped through the territory of a third country, do not undergo any operation other than unloading, reloading, or any operation necessary to transport them to the territory of the other Party or to preserve them in good condition; and

“(3) the documents related to the exportation and shipment of the goods from the territory of a Party show the territory of the other Party as their final destination.


“(c) Interpretation.—In interpreting this section, the following apply:“(1) Whenever the processing or assembly of goods in the territory of either Party or both Parties results in one of the changes in tariff classification described in the Annex rules, such goods shall be considered to have been transformed in the territory of that Party and shall be treated as goods originating in the territory of that Party if—“(A) such processing or assembly occurs entirely within the territory of either Party or both Parties; and

“(B) such goods have not subsequently undergone any processing or assembly outside the territories of the Parties that improves the goods in condition or advances them in value.

“(B) the tariff subheading for the goods provides for both the goods themselves and their parts;


such goods shall not be treated as goods originating in the territory of a Party.

“(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), goods described in that paragraph shall be considered to have been transformed in the territory of a Party and be treated as goods originating in the territory of the Party if—“(A) the value of materials originating in the territory of either Party or both Parties used or consumed in the production of the goods plus the direct cost of assembling the goods in the territory of either Party or both Parties constitute not less than 50 percent of the value of the goods when exported to the territory of the other Party; and

“(4) The provisions of paragraph (3) shall not apply to goods of chapters 61–63 of the Harmonized System.
