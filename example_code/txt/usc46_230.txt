Section 8502 sets forth the provisions and requirements for pilots licensed under section 7101. It is an exception provided by law envisioned under section 8501(a).
Subsection (a) applies the requirement for a Federal pilot to coastwise seagoing vessels if propelled by machinery and inspected under part B or if inspected under chapter 37, including a tank barge. The section has been carefully worded to clearly set out those vessels that are required at times to have a Federal pilot.
Subsection (b) prohibits Federal pilot fees from being higher than those required for State pilots. Subsections (c) and (d) prohibit States from imposing impediments to the proper performance of, or levying charges related to, Federal pilotage.
Subsections (e) and (f) prescribe civil penalties for violation of this section.
