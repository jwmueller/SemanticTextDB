In subsection (b), the words “The Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Maritime Affairs shall, ex officio, be the Administrator” in section 201 of Reorganization Plan No. 7 of 1961 are omitted as superseded by 46 App. U.S.C. 1601 and 1603. The words “and who shall be compensated at the rate provided for level III of the Executive Schedule” in 46 App. U.S.C. 1603 are omitted as unnecessary because of 5 U.S.C. 5314.
In subsection (c), the word “Secretary” means the “Secretary of Transportation” because under 46 App. U.S.C. 1602 all functions, powers, and duties relating to the Maritime Administration were transferred from the Secretary of Commerce to the Secretary of Transportation.

In subsection (f), the words “vessels of the United States” are substituted for “vessels of United States registry” because of the definition of “vessel of the United States” in chapter 1 of the revised title.
In subsection (g), the words “equal to the amount that would be paid to an individual performing work the Secretary considers to be of similar importance, difficulty, and responsibility” are substituted for “equal to the pay and allowances he would receive if he were the incumbent of an office or position in such service (or in the corresponding executive department), which, in the opinion of . . . the Secretary of Transportation, involves the performance of work similar in importance, difficulty, and responsibility” to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsection (h)(2), the words “according to approved commercial practice as provided in the Act of March 20, 1922 (42 Stat. 444)” are omitted as obsolete and unnecessary.
In subsection (i)(2), the words “Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or any other law” are omitted as unnecessary. In clause (G), the words “National Defense Reserve Fleet” are substituted for “reserve fleet” for clarity. Clause (H) is substituted for “(7) maritime training at the Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, New York”, “(8) financial assistance to State maritime academies under section 1295c of this Appendix”, “(10) expenses necessary for additional training provided under section 1295d of this Appendix”, and “(10) expenses necessary to carry out subchapter XIII of this chapter” because of the reorganization of revised title 46 and to eliminate unnecessary words. The text of 46 App. U.S.C. 1119 (proviso) is omitted as obsolete.
