Amendments2002—Pub. L. 107–355 reenacted section catchline without change and amended text generally. Prior to amendment, text read as follows: “Under regulations the Secretary of Transportation prescribes, each owner or operator of a gas pipeline facility shall carry out a program to educate the public on the use of a one-call notification system prior to excavation, the possible hazards associated with gas leaks, and the importance of reporting gas odors and leaks to the appropriate authority. The Secretary may develop material suitable for use in the program.”
1996—Pub. L. 104–304 substituted “owner or operator of a gas pipeline facility” for “person transporting gas”, inserted “the use of a one-call notification system prior to excavation,” after “educate the public on”, and inserted comma after “gas leaks”.
