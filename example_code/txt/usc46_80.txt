Section 3317 provides the regulatory authority for prescribing fees for the inspection of small passenger vessels and sailing school vessels. Although section 2110 generally prohibits fees of this nature, this provision is consistent with the exception that permits specific statutory authorization for fee collection. Subsection (b) requires the reimbursement of expenses for the conduct of an inspection or examination at a foreign port or place when done there for the convenience of the owner or operator of the vessel.

Amendments1992—Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 102–587 substituted “under this part of a documented vessel or a foreign vessel” for “under this chapter of a documented vessel”.
