Except as otherwise provided in subchapters II to VII of this chapter, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall, as promptly as may be practicable and in the public interest, remove (by demolition or otherwise) all housing under his jurisdiction which is of a temporary character, as determined by him, and constructed under the provisions of this subchapter, Public Law 781, Seventy-sixth Congress, and Public Laws 9, 73, 353, Seventy-seventh Congress. Such removal shall, in any event, be accomplished not later than July 1, 1954 or by such later date as may be required because of extensions of time in accordance with section 1584 of this title, with the exception only of such housing as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, after consultation with local communities, finds is still urgently needed because of a particularly acute housing shortage in the area: Provided, That all such exceptions shall be reexamined annually by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and that all such exceptions and reexaminations shall be reported to the Congress. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law except provisions of law hereafter enacted expressly in limitation hereof, no Federal statute, or regulation thereunder, shall prohibit or restrict any action or proceeding to recover possession of any housing accommodations for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this section or section 1584 of this title.
