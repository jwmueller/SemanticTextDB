(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 955; Pub. L. 96–417, title V, § 510, Oct. 10, 1980, 94 Stat. 1743; Pub. L. 102–572, title IX, § 908(a), (b)(1), Oct. 29, 1992, 106 Stat. 4519.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 80 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 37, 36 Stat. 1098).
Words “dismissed for want of jurisdiction” were substituted for “it shall appear to the satisfaction of the said district court, at any time after such suit has been brought or removed thereto, that such suit does not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy properly within the jurisdiction of said district court”. The substituted language is sufficient. (See reviser’s note under section 1359 of this title.) The provisions of section 80 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to dismissal for improper or collusive joinder in removal proceedings, are incorporated in section 1359 of this title. Other provisions of section 80 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., appear in section 1447 of this title.
Changes were made in phraseology.
