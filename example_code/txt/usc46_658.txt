The words “are deemed to have been retained for the reasonable needs of the business within the meaning of section 537(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 537(a))” are substituted for “shall not constitute an accumulation of earnings or profits within the meaning of section 102 of the Internal Revenue Code” because section 102 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 has been superseded by part 1 of subchapter G of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 531 et seq.). See also 46 C.F.R. § 287.16 (2003).
