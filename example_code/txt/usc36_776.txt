(a) designation and heading and pars. (1) and (2), was executed by substituting the new subsec. (a) designation, heading, and pars. for the existing subsec. (a) to reflect the probable intent of Congress. Prior to amendment, text read as follows: “There are authorized to be appropriated to the Library of Congress amounts necessary to carry out this chapter, not to exceed $530,000 for each of the fiscal years 2005 through 2009.
