3090346 App.:742 (1st, 3d sentences).Mar. 9, 1920, ch. 95, § 2 (1st, 3d sentences), 41 Stat. 525; Pub. L. 86–770, § 3, Sept. 13, 1960, 74 Stat. 912; Pub. L. 104–324, title XI, § 1105, Oct. 19, 1996, 110 Stat. 3967.


In subsection (a), the words “civil action” are substituted for “proceeding” and “libel” because of rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.) and for consistency in the chapter. The words “civil action in admiralty in personam” are substituted for “any appropriate nonjury proceeding in personam” for clarity. The words “in rem or in personam in any district” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “admiralty claim” are substituted for “cross libel” for consistency in this chapter and with the various means of asserting a claim (such as by counterclaim or cross-claim) allowed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The words “with the same force and effect as if the libel had been filed by a private party” are omitted as unnecessary.
Subsection (b) is substituted for the word “nonjury” to clarify that the nonjury requirement applies to any claim against the United States or a federally-owned corporation under this section regardless of which party brings the action.
