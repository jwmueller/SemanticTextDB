The words “at all times” are omitted as unnecessary. The word “have” is substituted for “maintain”, the words “to receive” are substituted for “authorized to accept”, and the words “is notice to or service on” are substituted for “shall be deemed as service upon or notice to”, for consistency in the revised title.
