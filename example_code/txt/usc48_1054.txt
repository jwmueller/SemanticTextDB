“Section 231“(a) The annual expenditure by the Government of Palau of the grant amounts specified in Article I of this Title shall be in accordance with an official national development plan promulgated by the Government of Palau and concurred in by the Government of the United States prior to the effective date of this Compact. This plan may be amended from time to time by the Government of Palau.

“(b) The Government of the United States and the Government of Palau recognize that the achievement of the goals of the plan referred to in this Section depends upon the availability of adequate internal revenue as well as economic assistance from sources outside of Palau, including the Government of the United States, and may, in addition, be affected by the impact of exceptional, economically adverse circumstances. The Government of Palau shall therefore report annually to the President of the United States and to the Congress of the United States on the implementation of this plan and on its use of the funds specified in this Article. This report shall outline the achievements of the plan to date and the need, if any, for an additional authorization and appropriation of economic assistance for that year to account for any exceptional, economically adverse circumstances. The availability of such additional economic assistance from the Government of the United States shall be subject to the authorization and appropriation of funds by the Government of the United States.
