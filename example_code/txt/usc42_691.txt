Teen Suicide Prevention StudyPub. L. 106–386, div. B, title VI, § 1602, Oct. 28, 2000, 114 Stat. 1538, provided that:
“(a) Short Title.—This section may be cited as the ‘Teen Suicide Prevention Act of 2000’.

“(b) Findings.—Congress finds that—“(1) measures that increase public awareness of suicide as a preventable public health problem, and target parents and youth so that suicide risks and warning signs can be recognized, will help to eliminate the ignorance and stigma of suicide as barriers to youth and families seeking preventive care;

“(2) suicide prevention efforts in the year 2000 should—“(A) target at-risk youth, particularly youth with mental health problems, substance abuse problems, or contact with the juvenile justice system;

“(B) involve—“(i) the identification of the characteristics of the at-risk youth and other youth who are contemplating suicide, and barriers to treatment of the youth; and

“(ii) the development of model treatment programs for the youth;


“(C) include a pilot study of the outcomes of treatment for juvenile delinquents with mental health or substance abuse problems;

“(D) include a public education approach to combat the negative effects of the stigma of, and discrimination against individuals with, mental health and substance abuse problems; and

“(E) include a nationwide effort to develop, implement, and evaluate a mental health awareness program for schools, communities, and families;


“(3) although numerous symptoms, diagnoses, traits, characteristics, and psychosocial stressors of suicide have been investigated, no single factor or set of factors has ever come close to predicting suicide with accuracy;

“(4) research of United States youth, such as a 1994 study by Lewinsohn, Rohde, and Seeley, has shown predictors of suicide, such as a history of suicide attempts, current suicidal ideation and depression, a recent attempt or completed suicide by a friend, and low self-esteem; and

“(5) epidemiological data illustrate—“(A) the trend of suicide at younger ages as well as increases in suicidal ideation among youth in the United States; and

“(B) distinct differences in approaches to suicide by gender, with—“(i) 3 to 5 times as many females as males attempting suicide; and

“(ii) 3 to 5 times as many males as females completing suicide.




“(c) Purpose.—The purpose of this section is to provide for a study of predictors of suicide among at-risk and other youth, and barriers that prevent the youth from receiving treatment, to facilitate the development of model treatment programs and public education and awareness efforts.

“(d) Study.—Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 28, 2000], the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall carry out, directly or by grant or contract, a study that is designed to identify—“(1) the characteristics of at-risk and other youth age 13 through 21 who are contemplating suicide;

“(2) the characteristics of at-risk and other youth who are younger than age 13 and are contemplating suicide; and

“(3) the barriers that prevent youth described in paragraphs (1) and (2) from receiving treatment.


“(e) Authorization of Appropriations.—There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section such sums as may be necessary.”
