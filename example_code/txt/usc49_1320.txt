In subsection (a), the text of 49 App.:2226d(e)(1) is omitted because the complete name of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration is used the first time the term appears in a section.
In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words “Subject to subsections (c) and (d) of this section” are added to alert the reader to the limitations in those subsections. In clause (1), the words “requires making the contract with the domestic firm” are substituted for “so requires” for clarity. The words “considering United States international obligations and trade relations” are substituted for “In determining under this subsection whether the public interest so requires, the Administrator shall take into account United States international obligations and trade relations” to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (4), the words “when completely assembled” are omitted as surplus. The words “produced in the United States” are substituted for “domestically produced” for consistency with clause (3).
In subsection (c), the words “(1) such applicability would not be in the public interest” are omitted as redundant to subsection (b)(1) of the revised section.
In subsection (e)(1), the words “foreign firms” are substituted for “foreign entities” for consistency in the revised section.
Subsection (e)(3) is substituted for “the number of contracts covered under this subtitle (including the amendments made by this subtitle) and awarded based upon the parameters of this section” to eliminate unnecessary words.

Amendments1999—Subsecs. (c)(2), (e)(2). Pub. L. 106–36 substituted “multilateral trade agreements (as defined in section 3501(4) of title 19)” for “General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade”.
