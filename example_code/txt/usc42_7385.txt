(2) Minimum allotmentsIn any case in which—(A) the total amount appropriated under section 15045 of this title for a fiscal year is not less than $20,000,000, the allotment under paragraph (1) for such fiscal year—(i) to each of American Samoa, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands may not be less than $107,000; and

(ii) to any State not described in clause (i) may not be less than $200,000; or

(ii) to any State not described in clause (i) may not be less than $150,000.



(3) Reduction of allotmentNotwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), if the aggregate of the amounts to be allotted to the States pursuant to such paragraphs for any fiscal year exceeds the total amount appropriated for such allotments under section 15045 of this title for such fiscal year, the amount to be allotted to each State for such fiscal year shall be proportionately reduced.


(4) Increase in allotmentsIn any year in which the total amount appropriated under section 15045 of this title for a fiscal year exceeds the total amount appropriated under such section (or a corresponding provision) for the preceding fiscal year by a percentage greater than the most recent percentage change in the Consumer Price Index published by the Secretary of Labor under section 720(c)(1) of title 29 (if the percentage change indicates an increase), the Secretary shall increase each of the minimum allotments described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2). The Secretary shall increase each minimum allotment by an amount that bears the same ratio to the amount of such minimum allotment (including any increases in such minimum allotment under this paragraph (or a corresponding provision) for prior fiscal years) as the amount that is equal to the difference between—(A) the total amount appropriated under section 15045 of this title for the fiscal year for which the increase in the minimum allotment is being made; minus

(B) the total amount appropriated under section 15045 of this title (or a corresponding provision) for the immediately preceding fiscal year,
