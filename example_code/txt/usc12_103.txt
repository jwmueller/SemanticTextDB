§ 141. Omitted
Codification
Section, R.S. § 5191 (part); acts Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, § 2 (part), 38 Stat. 251; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, title II, § 203(a), 49 Stat. 704, which set out a list of reserve and central reserve cities and permitted the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to reclassify, add to, or terminate the designation of such cities, was apparently included in the 1926 ed. of the Code on the basis of authorities other than the source credits. Accordingly, and because the continuing accuracy of the table was doubtful, this section was omitted.
Some of the other provisions of R.S. § 5191 are classified to sections 142 and 143 of this title and some were not included in the Code.
For classification of other provisions of section 2 of act Dec. 23, 1913, see Codification note set out under section 222 of this title.
