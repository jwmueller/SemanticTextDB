(6)[Uncodified].Aug. 14, 1961, Pub. L. 87–139, § 8(c), 75 Stat. 340.


In paragraph (1), the word “agency” is substituted for “departments and establishments”. The terms “Executive agency” and “military department” are substituted for “any executive department, independent commission, board, bureau, office, agency, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government, including wholly owned Government corporations” in view of the definitions in sections 105 and 102. The exception of “a Government controlled corporation” is added in subparagraph (i) to preserve the application of this subchapter to “wholly owned Government corporations”.
Paragraph (2) is added for convenience and to eliminate the necessity of referring to “civilian officers and employees of the agencies” elsewhere in the text of the subchapter.
In paragraph (4), the words “for subsistence and fees or tips to porters and stewards” are added on authority of the words “in lieu of their actual expenses of subsistence and all fees or tips to porters and stewards” and “in lieu of subsistence” in former sections 836 and 73b–2, which are carried into sections 5702 and 5703, respectively.
Paragraph (5) is added for convenience and is based in part on former section 835(1)(A) and, insofar as concerns section 5703, on section 18 of the Act of Aug. 2, 1946, ch. 744, 60 Stat. 811.
Paragraph (6), insofar as concerns section 5703, is based in part on section 18 of the Act of Aug. 2, 1946, ch. 744, 60 Stat. 811.
The definition of “Member of Congress” in former section 835(4) is omitted as unnecessary in view of the definition of “Member of Congress” in section 2106.
Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
