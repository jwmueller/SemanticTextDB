Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 223 and § 11–205 District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed. (Feb. 9, 1893, ch. 74, § 6, 27 Stat. 435; July 30, 1894, ch. 172, § 2, 28 Stat. 161; Mar. 3, 1901, ch. 854, § 225, 31 Stat. 1225; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 126, 36 Stat. 1132; July 17, 1916, ch. 246, 39 Stat. 385; Jan. 8, 1925, ch. 57, 43 Stat. 729; July 3, 1926, ch. 735, 44 Stat. 809; Feb. 28, 1929, ch. 363, § 3, 45 Stat. 1347; May 17, 1932, ch. 190, 47 Stat. 158).
This section consolidates section 223 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with part of section 11–205 of the District of Columbia Code.
Reference to San Juan as a place for holding court in the First Circuit was omitted. The revised section will permit the holding of terms at San Juan when the public interest requires.
The phrase “and at such other places within the respective circuits as may be designated by rule of court” was added to enable each court of appeals to hold such additional regular terms as changing circumstances might require.
The provisions of such section 223, for furnishing suitable rooms and accommodation at Oakland City, were omitted as obsolete since the erection of a new Federal building there.
The provisions as to fixed times for holding court in the Fifth Circuit was omitted as inconsistent with the practice in the other circuits. Words “San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle” were substituted for “San Francisco and two other places designated by the court” to conform with the practice in the Ninth Circuit.
Changes were made in phraseology.
