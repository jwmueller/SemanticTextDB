“SEC. 4111. ASSURANCES.“(a) Small Business Lending Fund Separate From TARP.—The Small Business Lending Fund Program is established as separate and distinct from the Troubled Asset Relief Program established by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 [div. A of Pub. L. 110–343, see Short Title note set out under section 5201 of this title]. An institution shall not, by virtue of a capital investment under the Small Business Lending Fund Program, be considered a recipient of the Troubled Asset Relief Program.

“(b) Change in Law.—If, after a capital investment has been made in an eligible institution under the Program, there is a change in law that modifies the terms of the investment or program in a materially adverse respect for the eligible institution, the eligible institution may, after consultation with the appropriate Federal banking agency for the eligible institution, repay the investment without impediment.
