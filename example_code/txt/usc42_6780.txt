For the purpose of this part, the term “affordable housing” includes permanent housing for disabled homeless persons, transitional housing, and single room occupancy housing.

(B) the jurisdiction’s housing needs cannot be met through rehabilitation of the available stock.


The Secretary shall not restrict a participating jurisdiction’s choice of rehabilitation, substantial rehabilitation, new construction, reconstruction, acquisition, or other eligible housing use unless such restriction is explicitly authorized under section 12753(2) of this title.

(3) Tenant-based rental assistance(A) In generalA participating jurisdiction may use funds provided under this part for tenant-based rental assistance only if—(i) the jurisdiction certifies that the use of funds under this part for tenant-based rental assistance is an essential element of the jurisdiction’s annual housing strategy for expanding the supply, affordability, and availability of decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing, and specifies the local market conditions that lead to the choice of this option; and

(ii) the tenant-based rental assistance is provided in accordance with written tenant selection policies and criteria that are consistent with the purposes of providing housing to very low- and low-income families and are reasonably related to preference rules established under section 1437d(c)(4)(A) 11 See References in Text note below. of this title.


(B) Fair share not affectedA jurisdiction’s section 8 [42 U.S.C. 1437f] fair share allocation shall be unaffected by the use of assistance under this subchapter.


(C) 24-month contractsRental assistance contracts made available with assistance under this subchapter shall be for not more than 24 months, except that assistance to a family may be renewed.


(D) Use of section 1437f assistanceIn any case where assistance under section 1437f of this title becomes available to a participating jurisdiction, recipients of rental assistance under this subchapter shall qualify for tenant selection preferences to the same extent as when they received the rental assistance under this subchapter. A rental assistance program under this subchapter shall meet minimum criteria prescribed by the Secretary, such as housing quality standards and standards regarding the reasonableness of the rent.


(E) Security deposit assistanceA jurisdiction using funds provided under this part for tenant-based rental assistance may use such funds to provide loans or grants to very low- and low-income families for security deposits for rental of dwelling units.

Each participating jurisdiction shall have the right to establish the terms of assistance.


(c) Administrative costsIn each fiscal year, each participating jurisdiction may use not more than 10 percent of the funds made available under this part to the jurisdiction for such year for any administrative and planning costs of the jurisdiction in carrying out this part, including the costs of the salaries of persons engaged in administering and managing activities assisted with funds made available under this part.


(d) Prohibited usesFunds made available under this part may not be used to—(1) defray any administrative cost of a participating jurisdiction that exceed the amount specified under subsection (c) of this section,

(2) provide tenant-based rental assistance for the special purposes of the existing section 8 [42 U.S.C. 1437f] program, including replacing public housing that is demolished or disposed of, preserving federally assisted housing, assisting in the disposition of housing owned or held by the Secretary, preventing displacement from rental rehabilitation projects, or extending or renewing tenant-based assistance under section 1437f of this title,

(e) Cost limits(1) In generalThe Secretary shall establish limits on the amount of funds under this part that may be invested on a per unit basis. For multifamily housing, such limits shall not be less than the per unit dollar amount limitations set forth in section 1715l(d)(3)(ii) of title 12, as such limitations may be adjusted in accordance therewith, except that for purposes of this subsection the Secretary shall, by regulation, increase the per unit dollar amount limitations in any geographical area by an amount, not to exceed 140 percent, that equals the amount by which the costs of multifamily housing construction in the area exceed the national average of such costs. The limits shall be established on a market-by-market basis, with adjustments made for number of bedrooms, and shall reflect the actual cost of new construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation of housing that meets applicable State and local housing and building codes and the cost of land, including necessary site improvements. Adjustments shall be made annually to reflect inflation. Separate limits may be set for different eligible activities.


(2) CriteriaIn calculating per unit limits, the Secretary shall take into account that assistance under this subchapter is intended to—(A) provide nonluxury housing with suitable amenities;

(B) operate effectively in all jurisdictions;

(C) facilitate mixed-income housing; and

(D) reflect the costs associated with meeting the special needs of tenants or homeowners that the housing is designed to serve.


(3) ConsultationIn calculating cost limits, the Secretary shall consult with organizations that have expertise in the development of affordable housing, including national nonprofit organizations and national organizations representing private development firms and State and local governments.



(f) Certification of complianceThe requirements of section 3545(d) of this title shall be satisfied by a certification by a participating jurisdiction to the Secretary that the combination of Federal assistance provided to any housing project shall not be any more than is necessary to provide affordable housing.


(g) Limitation on operating assistanceA participating jurisdiction may not use more than 5 percent of its allocation under this part for the payment of operating expenses for community housing development organizations.
