In subsection (a), the words “a bureau in the Department of the Treasury” are added for clarity and consistency in chapter 3 of the revised title.
In subsection (b), the first sentence is substituted for the words before the first comma because of the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title. Clause (1) is substituted for “subject to the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words “and be responsible” are omitted as being included in “reports directly to” and because of section 301 of the revised title.
