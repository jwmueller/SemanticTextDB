(2) lands, and interests in lands, within the 1991 additions which are used for noncommercial residential purposes as of July 1, 1991, may be acquired only with the consent of the owner thereof unless the property is being developed, or is proposed to be developed, in a manner which the Secretary determines to be detrimental to the scenic, historical, cultural, and other values of the park.


Nothing in paragraph (2) shall be construed to prohibit the use of condemnation as a means of acquiring a clear and marketable title, free of any and all encumbrances for any lands within the 1991 additions. Not later than 6 months after October 24, 1992, and after notice and opportunity for public comment, the Secretary of the Interior shall publish specific guidelines for making determinations under paragraph (2).

(d) Private owner’s retention of right of use and occupancy(1) Any individual who owns private property acquired by the Secretary under subsection (c) of this section may, on the date of such acquisition and as a condition of such acquisition, retain for himself and his successors or assigns, a right of use and occupancy of the property for a definite term of not more than 25 years from the date of acquisition by the Secretary or a term ending at the death of the owner or the owner’s spouse, whichever is later. The owner shall elect the term to be reserved.

(2) Unless the property is wholly or partially donated, the Secretary shall pay to the owner reserving a right of use and occupancy under this subsection the fair market value of the property on the date of its acquisition, less the fair market value on that date of the right retained by the owner.

(3) For purposes of applying this subsection, ownership shall be determined as of July 1, 1991.
