Amendments1988—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 100–443, § 5(c)(1), inserted “or under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970” after “under this chapter” and directed that “oil and gas” be stricken which was executed by striking those words where they appeared after “not issue any” in introductory provisions, but not where they appeared in par. (3) as the probable intent of Congress.
Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 100–443, § 5(c)(2), inserted “, coal, oil shale, phosphate, potassium, sulphur, gilsonite or geothermal resources” after “oil and gas”.
