(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 769; Pub. L. 90–578, title IV, § 402(b)(2), Oct. 17, 1968, 82 Stat. 1118; Pub. L. 101–650, title III, § 321, Dec. 1, 1990, 104 Stat. 5117; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(F), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 245 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 140, 35 Stat. 1114).
The phrase “Except as otherwise expressly provided by law” was inserted because sections 2231, 2232, and 2233 of this title provide greater penalties for obstructing service of search warrants.
Mandatory provisions were rephrased in the alternative.
Minor changes were made in phraseology.
