“SEC. 301. SENSE OF CONGRESS RESOLUTION.“(a) Findings.—The Congress hereby makes the following findings:“(1) Congress has authorized 18 commemorative coin programs in the 9 years since 1984.

“(2) There are more meritorious causes, events, and people worthy of commemoration than can be honored with commemorative coinage.

“(3) Commemorative coin legislation has increased at a pace beyond that which the numismatic community can reasonably be expected to absorb.

“(4) It is in the interests of all Members of Congress that a policy be established to control the flow of commemorative coin legislation.


“(b) Declaration.—It is the sense of the Congress that the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs [now Committee on Financial Services] of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate should not report or otherwise clear for consideration by the House of Representatives or the Senate legislation providing for more than 2 commemorative coin programs for any year, unless the committee determines, on the basis of a recommendation by the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee, that extraordinary merit exists for an additional commemorative coin program.
