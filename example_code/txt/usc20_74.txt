“Sec. 3. There is authorized to be appropriated to the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution $40,000,000 for fiscal years beginning after September 30, 1984, for renovation and repair, after the transfer made under the first section of this Act, of the General Post Office Building referred to in such section. Any portion of the sums appropriated under this section may be transferred to the General Services Administration which, in consultation with the Smithsonian Institution, is authorized to enter into contracts and take such other action, to the extent of the sums so transferred to it, as may be necessary to carry out such renovation and repair. No contract for such renovation or repair shall be advertised or entered into before the end of the period of thirty days of continuous session of Congress beginning on the date the Smithsonian Institution submits to the Committees on Public Works and Transportation and House Administration of the House of Representatives and the Committees on Environment and Public Works and Rules and Administration of the Senate the plans and advanced engineering and design for such renovation and repair. For purposes of this section, continuity of session is broken only by an adjournment of Congress sine die, and the days on which either House is not in session because of an adjournment of more than three days to a day certain are excluded in the computation of any period of time in which Congress is in continuous session.”
