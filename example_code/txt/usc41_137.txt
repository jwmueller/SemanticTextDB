(2) Only under this section.—The head of an executive agency may enter into a task order contract for advisory and assistance services only under this section.


(c) Contract Period.—The period of a task order contract entered into under this section, including all periods of extensions of the contract under options, modifications, or otherwise, may not exceed 5 years unless a longer period is specifically authorized in a law that is applicable to the contract.

(d) Content of Notice.—The notice required by section 1708 of this title and section 8(e) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(e)) shall reasonably and fairly describe the general scope, magnitude, and duration of the proposed task order contract in a manner that would reasonably enable a potential offeror to decide whether to request the solicitation and consider submitting an offer.

(e) Required Content of Solicitation and Contract.—(1) Solicitation.—The solicitation shall include the information (regarding services) described in section 4103(b) of this title.

(2) Contract.—A task order contract entered into under this section shall contain the same information that is required by paragraph (1) to be included in the solicitation of offers for that contract.


(f) Multiple Awards.—(1) Authority to make multiple awards.—On the basis of one solicitation, the head of an executive agency may award separate task order contracts under this section for the same or similar services to 2 or more sources if the solicitation states that the head of the executive agency has the option to do so.

(2) Content of solicitation.—In the case of a task order contract for advisory and assistance services to be entered into under this section, if the contract period is to exceed 3 years and the contract amount is estimated to exceed $10,000,000 (including all options), the solicitation shall—(A) provide for a multiple award authorized under paragraph (1); and

(3) Nonapplication.—Paragraph (2) does not apply in the case of a solicitation for which the head of the executive agency concerned determines in writing that, because the services required under the contract are unique or highly specialized, it is not practicable to award more than one contract.
