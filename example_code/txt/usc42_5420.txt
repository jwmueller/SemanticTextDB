“SEC. 6102. PARTICULATE MATTER MONITORING PROGRAM.“(a) Through grants under section 103 of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7403] the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall use appropriated funds no later than fiscal year 2000 to fund 100 percent of the cost of the establishment, purchase, operation and maintenance of a PM2.5 monitoring network necessary to implement the national ambient air quality standards for PM2.5 under section 109 of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7409]. This implementation shall not result in a diversion or reprogramming of funds from other Federal, State or local Clean Air Act activities. Any funds previously diverted or reprogrammed from section 105 Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7405] grants for PM2.5 monitors must be restored to State or local air programs in fiscal year 1999.

“(b) EPA and the States, consistent with their respective authorities under the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.], shall ensure that the national network (designated in subsection (a)) which consists of the PM2.5 monitors necessary to implement the national ambient air quality standards is established by December 31, 1999.

“(c)(1) The Governors shall be required to submit designations referred to in section 107(d)(1) of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7407(d)(1)] for each area following promulgation of the July 1997 PM2.5 national ambient air quality standard within 1 year after receipt of 3 years of air quality monitoring data performed in accordance with any applicable Federal reference methods for the relevant areas. Only data from the monitoring network designated in subsection (a) and other Federal reference method PM2.5 monitors shall be considered for such designations. Nothing in the previous sentence shall be construed as affecting the Governor’s authority to designate an area initially as nonattainment, and the Administrator’s authority to promulgate the designation of an area as nonattainment, under section 107(d)(1) of the Clean Air Act, based on its contribution to ambient air quality in a nearby nonattainment area.

“(2) For any area designated as nonattainment for the July 1997 PM2.5 national ambient air quality standard in accordance with the schedule set forth in this section, notwithstanding the time limit prescribed in paragraph (2) of section 169B(e) of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7492(e)(2)], the Administrator shall require State implementation plan revisions referred to in such paragraph (2) to be submitted at the same time as State implementation plan revisions referred to in section 172 of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7502] implementing the revised national ambient air quality standard for fine particulate matter are required to be submitted. For any area designated as attainment or unclassifiable for such standard, the Administrator shall require the State implementation plan revisions referred to in such paragraph (2) to be submitted 1 year after the area has been so designated. The preceding provisions of this paragraph shall not preclude the implementation of the agreements and recommendations set forth in the Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission Report dated June 1996.


“(d) The Administrator shall promulgate the designations referred to in section 107(d)(1) of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7407(d)(1)] for each area following promulgation of the July 1997 PM2.5 national ambient air quality standard by the earlier of 1 year after the initial designations required under subsection (c)(1) are required to be submitted or December 31, 2005.

“(e) Field Study.—Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of the SAFETEA–LU [Aug. 10, 2005], the Administrator shall—“(1) conduct a field study of the ability of the PM2.5 Federal Reference Method to differentiate those particles that are larger than 2.5 micrometers in diameter;

“(2) develop a Federal reference method to measure directly particles that are larger than 2.5 micrometers in diameter without reliance on subtracting from coarse particle measurements those particles that are equal to or smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter;

“(3) develop a method of measuring the composition of coarse particles; and

“(4) submit a report on the study and responsibilities of the Administrator under paragraphs (1) through (3) to—“(A) the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives; and

“(B) the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate.
