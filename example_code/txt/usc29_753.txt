“Sec. 9. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the Administrator may withhold or deny approval of a veteran’s entry into an approved program of job training if the Administrator determines that funds are not available to make payments under this Act on behalf of the veteran to the employer offering that program. Before the entry of a veteran into an approved program of job training of an employer for purposes of assistance under this Act, the employer shall notify the Administrator of the employer’s intention to employ that veteran. The veteran may begin such program of job training with the employer two weeks after the notice is transmitted to the Administrator unless within that time the employer has received notice from the Administrator that approval of the veteran’s entry into that program of job training must be withheld or denied in accordance with this section.
