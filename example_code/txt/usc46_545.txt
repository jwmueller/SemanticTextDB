In subsections (a) and (b), the words “In carrying out” are substituted for “In furtherance of the purposes of” and “In proceedings under” for clarity and consistency.
In subsection (b)(1), the words “subpoena witnesses and evidence” are substituted for “by subpoena compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers, documents, and other evidence” for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsection (b)(2), the words “conform to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.)” are substituted for “are in conformity with the rules applicable in civil proceedings in the district courts of the United States” for clarity.
In subsection (d)(2), the penalties from 46 App. U.S.C. 876(f)(4) and (g)(4)(B) are combined because they are redundant.
In subsection (e), the words “by an appropriate injunction or other process, mandatory or otherwise” are omitted as unnecessary.
