Whoever knowingly makes any false statement for the purpose of influencing in any way the action of the Secretary of Agriculture, or of any person acting under his authority, in connection with any compromise, adjustment, or cancellation of any farm indebtedness as provided by sections 1150, 1150a, and 1150b of Title 12, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.
(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 755; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(H), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 1150c(a) of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking (Dec. 20, 1944, ch. 623, § 4(a), 58 Stat. 837).
Words “of Agriculture” were inserted after “Secretary” for reasons of identification.
Words “upon conviction thereof” were omitted as surplusage, since punishment can not be imposed until after conviction.
Other changes were made in phraseology without change of substance.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $1,000”.
