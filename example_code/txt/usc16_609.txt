“Sec. 4. (a) The management and use of parklands on Isle au Haut shall not interfere with the maintenance of a viable local community with a traditional resource-based economy outside the boundary of the park. To the maximum extent practicable, no development or plan for the convenience of park visitors shall be undertaken which would be incompatible with the preservation of the flora and fauna or the physiographic conditions now prevailing, and every effort shall be exerted to maintain and preserve this portion of the park in as nearly its present state and condition as possible. In recognition of the special fragility and sensitivity of the park’s resources, visitation shall be strictly limited to assure negligible adverse impact on such resources, to conserve the character of the town and to protect the quality of the visitor experience.

“[(b), (c) Repealed. Pub. L. 104–333, div. I, title VIII, § 814(d)(1)(C), Nov. 12, 1996, 110 Stat. 4196.]

“(d) Carrying capacities established pursuant to this section shall be reviewed, and if necessary revised, every five years. Any revision in such carrying capacity shall be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.

“(e) Until such time as a carrying capacity limitation is established and implemented pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the Secretary shall take such temporary measures as are necessary to assure that visitation does not exceed the average annual visitation for the period 1979 to 1981.
