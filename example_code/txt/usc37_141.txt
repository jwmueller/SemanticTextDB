A payment of an allowance, based on a purported marriage, that is made under this chapter, under the Career Compensation Act of 1949, or under the Pay Readjustment Act of 1942, before judicial annulment or termination of that marriage, is valid, if a court of competent jurisdiction adjudges or decrees that the marriage was entered into in good faith on the part of the spouse who is a member of a uniformed service or if, in the absence of such a judgment or decree, such a finding of good faith is made by the Secretary concerned or by a person designated by him to investigate the matter.
