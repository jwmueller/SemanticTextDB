§ 144. National bridge and tunnel inventory and inspection standards(a) Findings and Declarations.—(1) Findings.—Congress finds that—(A) the condition of the bridges of the United States has improved since the date of enactment of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (Public Law 105–178; 112 Stat. 107), yet continued improvement to bridge conditions is essential to protect the safety of the traveling public and allow for the efficient movement of people and goods on which the economy of the United States relies; and

(B) the systematic preventative maintenance of bridges, and replacement and rehabilitation of deficient bridges, should be undertaken through an overall asset management approach to transportation investment.


(2) Declarations.—Congress declares that it is in the vital interest of the United States—(A) to inventory, inspect, and improve the condition of the highway bridges and tunnels of the United States;

(B) to use a data-driven, risk-based approach and cost-effective strategy for systematic preventative maintenance, replacement, and rehabilitation of highway bridges and tunnels to ensure safety and extended service life;

(C) to use performance-based bridge management systems to assist States in making timely investments;

(D) to ensure accountability and link performance outcomes to investment decisions; and

(E) to ensure connectivity and access for residents of rural areas of the United States through strategic investments in National Highway System bridges and bridges on all public roads.



(b) National Bridge and Tunnel Inventories.—The Secretary, in consultation with the States and Federal agencies with jurisdiction over highway bridges and tunnels, shall—(1) inventory all highway bridges on public roads, on and off Federal-aid highways, including tribally owned and Federally owned bridges, that are bridges over waterways, other topographical barriers, other highways, and railroads;

(2) inventory all tunnels on public roads, on and off Federal-aid highways, including tribally owned and Federally owned tunnels;

(3) classify the bridges according to serviceability, safety, and essentiality for public use, including the potential impacts to emergency evacuation routes and to regional and national freight and passenger mobility if the serviceability of the bridge is restricted or diminished;

(4) based on that classification, assign each a risk-based priority for systematic preventative maintenance, replacement, or rehabilitation; and

(5) determine the cost of replacing each structurally deficient bridge identified under this subsection with a comparable facility or the cost of rehabilitating the bridge.


(c) General Bridge Authority.—(1) In general.—Except as provided in paragraph (2) and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the General Bridge Act of 1946 (33 U.S.C. 525 et seq.) shall apply to bridges authorized to be replaced, in whole or in part, by this title.
