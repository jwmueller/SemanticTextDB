“SEC. 32704. FIRE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION.“(a) Research and Testing.—The Secretary shall conduct research and testing to determine the most prevalent causes of motorcoach fires and the best methods to prevent such fires and to mitigate the effect of such fires, both inside and outside the motorcoach. Such research and testing shall consider flammability of exterior components, smoke suppression, prevention of and resistance to wheel well fires, automatic fire suppression, passenger evacuation, causation and prevention of motorcoach fires, and improved fire extinguishers.

“(b) Standards.—Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary may issue fire prevention and mitigation standards for motorcoaches, based on the results of the Secretary’s research and testing, taking into account highway size and weight restrictions applicable to motorcoaches, if the Secretary determines that such standards meet the requirements and considerations set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of section 30111 of title 49, United States Code.
