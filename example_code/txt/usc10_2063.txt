§ 2922b. Procurement of energy systems using renewable forms of energy(a) In procuring energy systems the Secretary of a military department shall procure systems that use solar energy or other renewable forms of energy whenever the Secretary determines that such procurement is possible, suited to supplying the energy needs of the military department under the jurisdiction of the Secretary, consistent with the energy performance goals and energy performance plan for the Department of Defense developed under section 2911 of this title, and supported by the special considerations specified in subsection (c) of such section.

(b) The Secretary of Defense shall from time to time study uses for solar energy and other renewable forms of energy to determine what uses of such forms of energy may be reliable in supplying the energy needs of the Department of Defense. The Secretary of Defense, based upon the results of such studies, shall from time to time issue policy guidelines to be followed by the Secretaries of the military departments in carrying out subsection (a) and section 2915 of this title.

“(c)(1) For the purposes of this section, an energy system using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy shall be considered to be cost effective if the difference between (A) the original investment cost of the energy system using such a form of energy, and (B) the original investment cost of the energy system not using such a form of energy can be recovered over the expected life of the system.
“(2) A determination under paragraph (1) concerning whether a cost-differential can be recovered over the expected life of a system shall be made using the life-cycle cost methods and procedures established pursuant to section 544(a) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8254(a)).”
1991—Subsec. (c)(2). Pub. L. 102–25 inserted “(42 U.S.C. 8254(a))” after “Policy Act”.

Subsec. (c)(2), (3). Pub. L. 101–510, § 2852(a), added par. (2) and struck out former pars. (2) and (3) which read as follows:
“(2) A determination under paragraph (1) of whether a cost-differential can be recovered over the expected life of a system shall be made using accepted life-cycle costing procedures and shall include—
“(A) the use of all capital expenses and all operating and maintenance expenses associated with the energy system using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy, and not using such a form of energy, over the expected life of the system or during a period of 25 years, whichever is shorter;
“(B) the use of fossil fuel costs (and a rate of cost growth for fossil fuel costs) as determined by the Secretary of Defense; and
“(C) the use of a discount rate of 7 percent per year for all expenses of the energy system.
“(3) For the purpose of any life-cycle cost analysis under this subsection, the original investment cost of the energy system using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy shall be reduced by 10 percent to reflect an allowance for an investment cost credit.”
1984—Pub. L. 98–525 substituted “using” for “powered by” in section catchline.

Submission Date for First ReportPub. L. 97–321, title VIII, § 801(a)(3), Oct. 15, 1982, 96 Stat. 1571, required the first report under subsec. (b)(2) of this section to be submitted not later than two years after Oct. 15, 1982.
