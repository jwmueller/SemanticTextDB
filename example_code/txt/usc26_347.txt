“(a) Findings.—Congress finds as follows:“(1) The delegation of authority to the Secretary of the Treasury under section 382(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 does not authorize the Secretary to provide exemptions or special rules that are restricted to particular industries or classes of taxpayers.

“(2) Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008–83 is inconsistent with the congressional intent in enacting such section 382(m).

“(3) The legal authority to prescribe Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008–83 is doubtful.

“(4) However, as taxpayers should generally be able to rely on guidance issued by the Secretary of the Treasury legislation is necessary to clarify the force and effect of Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008–83 and restore the proper application under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 of the limitation on built-in losses following an ownership change of a bank.


“(b) Determination of Force and Effect of Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008–83 Exempting Banks From Limitation on Certain Built–in Losses Following Ownership Change.—“(1) In general.—Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008–83—“(A) shall be deemed to have the force and effect of law with respect to any ownership change (as defined in section 382(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) occurring on or before January 16, 2009, and

“(2) Binding contracts.—Notwithstanding paragraph (1), Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008–83 shall have the force and effect of law with respect to any ownership change (as so defined) which occurs after January 16, 2009, if such change—“(A) is pursuant to a written binding contract entered into on or before such date, or
