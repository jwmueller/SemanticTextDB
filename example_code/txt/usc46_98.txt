Section 3708 requires compliance with certain minimum standards by a self-propelled tank vessel. These requirements apply to any tank vessel of 10,000 gross tons or above with no distinction being made as to whether or not the vessel is “primarily” constructed or adapted to carry oil or hazardous material in bulk in the cargo spaces. These vessels are required to be equipped with a dual radar system, a computerized relative motion analyzer, an electronic position fixing device, adequate communications equipment, a sonic depth finder, a gyrocompass, and up-to-date charts.
