306(b)45:803(a).
306(c), (d)45:803(b).
306(e)45:803(c)–(e).


In subsection (b), the enumerated laws are substituted for “through financial assistance under this Act”, meaning the Rail Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (Pub. L. 94–210, 90 Stat. 31) and laws amended by that Act. The laws cited in the subsection are substituted for “through financial assistance under this Act” for clarity. The enumerated laws include provisions of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 that amend other laws as well as provisions that are not amendments to other laws. A reference to the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 (Pub. L. 88–365, 78 Stat. 302) is omitted because this section related to that Act is superseded by 49:1615.
In subsection (c), the word “decides” is substituted for “determines” for consistency. The word “ensure” is substituted for “assure” as being more precise.
In subsection (d), the words “at least one of the following actions” are substituted for “and/or” for clarity and consistency.
In subsection (e), the text of 45:803(d) is omitted as unnecessary because section 322 of the revised title gives the Secretary of Transportation general authority to prescribe regulations and other provisions of the revised title give the Secretary general authority to carry out his duties and powers. The text of 45:803(e) is omitted as unnecessary.

Pub. L. 98–216This is necessary to correct a cross-reference in section 306(b) and to reflect the transfer of the non-positive law provisions of title 49 to title 49 appendix.
