§ 1212. Capital loss carrybacks and carryovers(a) Corporations(1) In generalIf a corporation has a net capital loss for any taxable year (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as the “loss year”), the amount thereof shall be—(A) a capital loss carryback to each of the 3 taxable years preceding the loss year, but only to the extent—(i) such loss is not attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss, and

(ii) the carryback of such loss does not increase or produce a net operating loss (as defined in section 172(c)) for the taxable year to which it is being carried back;


(B) except as provided in subparagraph (C), a capital loss carryover to each of the 5 taxable years succeeding the loss year; and

(C) a capital loss carryover to each of the 10 taxable years succeeding the loss year, but only to the extent such loss is attributable to a foreign expropriation loss,


and shall be treated as a short-term capital loss in each such taxable year. The entire amount of the net capital loss for any taxable year shall be carried to the earliest of the taxable years to which such loss may be carried, and the portion of such loss which shall be carried to each of the other taxable years to which such loss may be carried shall be the excess, if any, of such loss over the total of the capital gain net income for each of the prior taxable years to which such loss may be carried. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the capital gain net income for any such prior taxable year shall be computed without regard to the net capital loss for the loss year or for any taxable year thereafter. In the case of any net capital loss which cannot be carried back in full to a preceding taxable year by reason of clause (ii) of subparagraph (A), the capital gain net income for such prior taxable year shall in no case be treated as greater than the amount of such loss which can be carried back to such preceding taxable year upon the application of such clause (ii).

(ii) losses (treated under section 165(g)(1) as losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets) from securities which become worthless by reason of the expropriation, intervention, seizure, or similar taking of property by the government of any foreign country, any political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of the foregoing.


(B) Portion of loss attributable to foreign expropriation capital lossFor purposes of paragraph (1), the portion of any net capital loss for any taxable year attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss is the amount of the foreign expropriation capital loss for such year (but not in excess of the net capital loss for such year).


(C) Priority of applicationFor purposes of paragraph (1), if a portion of a net capital loss for any taxable year is attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss, such portion shall be considered to be a separate net capital loss for such year to be applied after the other portion of such net capital loss.



(3) Regulated investment companies(A) In generalIf a regulated investment company has a net capital loss for any taxable year—(i) paragraph (1) shall not apply to such loss,

(b) Other taxpayers(1) In generalIf a taxpayer other than a corporation has a net capital loss for any taxable year—(A) the excess of the net short-term capital loss over the net long-term capital gain for such year shall be a short-term capital loss in the succeeding taxable year, and

(B) the excess of the net long-term capital loss over the net short-term capital gain for such year shall be a long-term capital loss in the succeeding taxable year.


(2) Treatment of amounts allowed under section 1211(b)(1) or (2)(A) In generalFor purposes of determining the excess referred to in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1), there shall be treated as a short-term capital gain in the taxable year an amount equal to the lesser of—(i) the amount allowed for the taxable year under paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1211(b), or

(3) Amount which may be used in any prior taxable yearAn amount shall be allowed as a carryback under paragraph (1) to any prior taxable year only to the extent—(A) such amount does not exceed the net section 1256 contract gain for such year, and

(B) the allowance of such carryback does not increase or produce a net operating loss (as defined in section 172(c)) for such year.


(4) Net section 1256 contracts lossFor purposes of paragraph (1), the term “net section 1256 contracts loss” means the lesser of—(A) the net capital loss for the taxable year determined by taking into account only gains and losses from section 1256 contracts, or

(ii) 60 percent of the amount allowed as a carryback shall be treated as a long-term capital gain for the loss year.


(B) Carryover loss retains character as attributable to section 1256 contractAny amount carried forward as a short-term or long-term capital loss to any taxable year under subsection (b)(1) (after the application of subparagraph (A)) shall, to the extent attributable to losses from section 1256 contracts, be treated as loss from section 1256 contracts for such taxable year.
