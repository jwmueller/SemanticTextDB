(d)(1) The Secretary shall carry out a program to demonstrate the feasibility of guaranteeing loans for the acquisition of an existing dwelling and the cost of making energy efficiency improvements to the dwelling or for energy efficiency improvements to a dwelling owned and occupied by a veteran. A loan may be guaranteed under this subsection only if it meets the requirements of this chapter, except as those requirements are modified by this subsection.

(2) The cost of energy efficiency measures that may be financed by a loan guaranteed under this section may not exceed the greater of—(A) the cost of the energy efficiency improvements, up to $3,000; or

(E) The term “residential energy conservation measure” means—(i) caulking and weatherstripping of all exterior doors and windows;

(ii) furnace efficiency modifications limited to—(I) replacement burners, boilers, or furnaces designed to reduce the firing rate or to achieve a reduction in the amount of fuel consumed as a result of increased combustion efficiency,

(B) the loan must be secured by the same dwelling or farm residence as was the loan being refinanced;

(C) the amount of the loan may not exceed—(i) an amount equal to the sum of the balance of the loan being refinanced and such closing costs (including any discount permitted pursuant to section 3703(c)(3)(A) of this title) as may be authorized by the Secretary (under regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe) to be included in the loan; or

(ii) in the case of a loan for the purpose specified in subsection (a)(11), an amount equal to the sum of the amount referred to with respect to the loan under clause (i) and the amount specified under subsection (d)(2);

(2) A loan to a veteran may be guaranteed by the Secretary under this chapter for the purpose specified in clause (8) of subsection (a) of this section without regard to the amount of outstanding guaranty entitlement available for use by such veteran, and the amount of such veteran’s guaranty entitlement shall not be charged as a result of any guaranty provided for such purpose. For purposes of section 3702(b) of this title, such loan shall be deemed to have been obtained with the guaranty entitlement used to obtain the loan being refinanced.

(3) If a veteran is deceased and if such veteran’s surviving spouse was a co-obligor under an existing loan guaranteed, insured, or made under this chapter, such surviving spouse shall, only for the purpose specified in subsection (a)(8) of this section, be deemed to be a veteran eligible for benefits under this chapter.


(f)(1) For a loan to be guaranteed for the purpose specified in subclause (A)(ii) or (B)(ii) of subsection (a)(9) of this section, the purchase of (or the refinancing of a loan secured by) the manufactured home and the lot for that home shall be considered as one loan and must comply with such criteria as may be prescribed by the Secretary in regulations.

(2) A loan may not be guaranteed for the purposes of subsection (a)(9) of this section unless the manufactured home purchased, upon being permanently affixed to the lot, is considered to be real property under the laws of the State where the lot is located.


(g)(1) For the purposes of this subsection, the term “veteran”, when used with respect to a loan guaranteed or to be guaranteed under this chapter, includes the veteran’s spouse if the spouse is jointly liable with the veteran under the loan.

(C) procedures for ascertaining the monthly income required by the veteran to meet the anticipated loan payment terms.


If the procedures described in clause (C) of this paragraph include standards for evaluating residual income, the Secretary shall, in establishing such standards, give appropriate consideration to State statistics (in States as to which the Secretary determines that such statistics are reliable) pertinent to residual income and the cost of living in the State in question rather than in a larger region.

(4)(A) Any lender making a loan under this chapter shall certify, in such form as the Secretary shall prescribe, that the lender has complied with the credit information and loan processing standards established under paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection, and that, to the best of the lender’s knowledge and belief, the loan meets the underwriting standards established under paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection.

All determinations necessary to carry out this subparagraph shall be made by the Secretary.


(5) Pursuant to regulations prescribed to carry out this paragraph, the Secretary may, in extraordinary situations, waive the application of the credit underwriting standards established under paragraph (2) of this subsection when the Secretary determines, considering the totality of circumstances, that the veteran is a satisfactory credit risk.


(h)(1) A loan may not be guaranteed under subsection (a)(12) unless—(A) the development, project, or structure of the cooperative housing corporation complies with such criteria as the Secretary prescribes in regulations; and

(B) the dwelling unit that the purchase of stock or membership in the development, project, or structure of the cooperative housing corporation entitles the purchaser to occupy is a single family residential unit.


(2) In this subsection, the term “cooperative housing corporation” has the meaning given such term in section 216(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(3) When applying the term “value of the property” to a loan guaranteed under subsection (a)(12), such term means the appraised value of the stock or membership entitling the purchaser to the permanent occupancy of the dwelling unit in the development, project, or structure of the cooperative housing corporation.
