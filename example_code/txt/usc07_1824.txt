References in TextThis chapter, referred to in subsec. (c), was in the original “this part”, and was translated as reading “this title”, meaning title III of Pub. L. 91–670, which enacted this chapter, as the probable intent of Congress, because title III does not contain parts.

Amendments1990—Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 101–624, § 1945(1), inserted “, or of the total number of producers and importers when importers are subject to a plan,” after first reference to “potato producers”, “and importers” after second reference to “potato producers”, and “and import” after “produce”, and substituted “and imported by those voting in the referendum” for “by the potato producers voting in the referendum”.
Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 101–624, § 1945(2), added subsec. (c).
