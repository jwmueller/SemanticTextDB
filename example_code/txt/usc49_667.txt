3030723:401 (note).Oct. 25, 1982, Pub. L. 97–364, § 208, 96 Stat. 1746; Dec. 30, 1987, Pub. L. 100–223, § 305(b)(1), 101 Stat. 1526.


In this section, the words “fined under title 18” are substituted for “fined not more than $10,000” for consistency with title 18.
In subsection (a), before clause (1), the reference to “section 30305(b)(6) of this title” is used to carry out the probable intent of Congress. Section 305(b)(1) of the Airport and Airway Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1987 (Public Law 100–223, 101 Stat. 1526) amended section 206(b) of the National Driver Register Act of 1982 (Public Law 97–364, 96 Stat. 1744) by “redesignating paragraphs (3) and (4), and any reference thereto, as paragraphs (4) and (5), respectively”. Because the reference to “section 206(b)(4)” in section 208 of the National Driver Register Act of 1982 appears to have been incorrect before that amendment, and would continue to be incorrect if the reference is redesignated as required by the amendment, a reference to section 30305(b)(6) is used in this section to carry out the probable intent of Congress.


References in TextSection 30305(b) of this title, referred to in subsec. (a), was amended by Pub. L. 105–178, title II, § 2006(b)(2)(A), (B), June 9, 1998, 112 Stat. 336, which added a new par. (6) and redesignated former par. (6) as (10).
