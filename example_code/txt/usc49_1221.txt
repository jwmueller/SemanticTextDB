(ii) the airport had at least 10,000 passenger boardings in the calendar year prior to the calendar year used to calculate apportionments to airport sponsors in a fiscal year; and

(ii) the life of the pavement will not be shorter than it would be if constructed using Administration standards.


(B) Limitation.—An airport may not seek funds under this subchapter for runway rehabilitation or reconstruction of any such airfield pavement constructed using State highway specifications for a period of 10 years after construction is completed unless the Secretary determines that the rehabilitation or reconstruction is required for safety reasons.
