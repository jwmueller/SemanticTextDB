(B) the adoption and enactment of such amendment; or

(C) the enactment of such bill or resolution in the form recommended in such conference report,


would cause the applicable allocation of new budget authority made under subsection (a) or (b) of this section for the first fiscal year or the total of fiscal years to be exceeded.

(ii) the adoption and enactment of that amendment; or

(iii) the enactment of that bill or resolution in the form recommended in that conference report,


would not increase the deficit, and, if the sum of any revenue increases provided in legislation already enacted during the current session (when added to revenue increases, if any, in excess of any outlay increase provided by the legislation proposed for consideration) is at least as great as the sum of the amount, if any, by which the aggregate level of Federal revenues should be increased as set forth in that concurrent resolution and the amount, if any, by which revenues are to be increased pursuant to pay-as-you-go procedures under section 632(b)(8) of this title, if included in that concurrent resolution.

(B) Section 642(a) of this title, as that section applies to revenues, shall not apply to any bill, joint resolution, amendment thereto, or conference report thereon if, for each fiscal year covered by the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget—(i) the enactment of that bill or resolution as reported;

(ii) the adoption and enactment of that amendment; or

(iii) the enactment of that bill or resolution in the form recommended in that conference report,


would not increase the deficit, and, if the sum of any outlay reductions provided in legislation already enacted during the current session (when added to outlay reductions, if any, in excess of any revenue reduction provided by the legislation proposed for consideration) is at least as great as the sum of the amount, if any, by which the aggregate level of Federal outlays should be reduced as required by that concurrent resolution and the amount, if any, by which outlays are to be reduced pursuant to pay-as-you-go procedures under section 632(b)(8) of this title, if included in that concurrent resolution.


(2) Revised allocations(A) As soon as practicable after Congress agrees to a bill or joint resolution that would have been subject to a point of order under subsection (f)(1) of this section but for the exception provided in paragraph (1)(A) or would have been subject to a point of order under section 642(a) of this title but for the exception provided in paragraph (1)(B), the chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives shall file with the House appropriately revised allocations under subsection (a) of this section and revised functional levels and budget aggregates to reflect that bill.

(B) Such revised allocations, functional levels, and budget aggregates shall be considered for the purposes of this Act as allocations, functional levels, and budget aggregates contained in the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget.
