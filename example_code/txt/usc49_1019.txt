Cape Town Treaty; Findings and PurposePub. L. 108–297, § 2, Aug. 9, 2004, 118 Stat. 1095, provided that:
“(a) Findings.—Congress finds the following:“(1) The Cape Town Treaty (as defined in section 44113 of title 49, United States Code) extends modern commercial laws for the sale, finance, and lease of aircraft and aircraft engines to the international arena in a manner consistent with United States law and practice.

“(2) The Cape Town Treaty provides for internationally established and recognized financing and leasing rights that will provide greater security and commercial predictability in connection with the financing and leasing of highly mobile assets, such as aircraft and aircraft engines.

“(3) The legal and financing framework of the Cape Town Treaty will provide substantial economic benefits to the aviation and aerospace sectors, including the promotion of exports, and will facilitate the acquisition of newer, safer aircraft around the world.

“(4) Only technical changes to United States law and regulations are required since the asset-based financing and leasing concepts embodied in the Cape Town Treaty are already reflected in the United States in the Uniform Commercial Code.

“(5) The new electronic registry system established under the Cape Town Treaty will work in tandem with current aircraft document recordation systems of the Federal Aviation Administration, which have served United States industry well.

“(6) The United States Government was a leader in the development of the Cape Town Treaty.


“(b) Purpose.—Accordingly, the purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 2004 Amendment note set out under section 40101 of this title] is to provide for the implementation of the Cape Town Treaty in the United States by making certain technical amendments to the provisions of chapter 441 of title 49, United States Code, directing the Federal Aviation Administration to complete the necessary rulemaking processes as expeditiously as possible, and clarifying the applicability of the Treaty during the rulemaking process.”
