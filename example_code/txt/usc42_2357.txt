For any school year, such payments shall be made to a State only if, during such school year, the amount of the State revenues (excluding State revenues derived from the operation of the program) appropriated or used specifically for program purposes (other than any State revenues expended for salaries and administrative expenses of the program at the State level) is not less than 30 percent of the funds made available to such State under section 1753 of this title for the school year beginning July 1, 1980.

(2) If, for any school year, the per capita income of a State is less than the average per capita income of all the States, the amount required to be expended by a State under paragraph (1) for such year shall be an amount bearing the same ratio to the amount equal to 30 percent of the funds made available to such State under section 1753 of this title for the school year beginning July 1, 1980, as the per capita income of such State bears to the average per capita income of all the States.

(c) Certification of payments by SecretaryThe Secretary shall certify to the Secretary of the Treasury, from time to time, the amounts to be paid to any State under this section and shall specify when such payments are to be made. The Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the State, at the time or times fixed by the Secretary, the amounts so certified.


(d) Combined Federal and State commodity purchasesNotwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may enter into an agreement with a State agency, acting on the request of a school food service authority, under which funds payable to the State under section 1753 or 1759a of this title may be used by the Secretary for the purpose of purchasing commodities for use by the school food service authority in meals served under the school lunch program under this chapter.
