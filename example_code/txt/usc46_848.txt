The words “This chapter and chapter 605 of this title” are substituted for “title 48 of the Revised Statutes” in 46 App. U.S.C. 135 because the provisions of title 48 of the Revised Statutes which are still alive and relate to tonnage or other duties on vessels are restated in these two chapters. Although these two chapters restate other provisions which are not from title 48 of the Revised Statutes, expansion of the reference to include those provisions is done for consistency.
