(2) payment of pay and all other identifiable costs of providing the services is made to the executive agency by the State or local government making the request.


(c) Payment received by an executive agency for providing services under this section shall be deposited to the credit of the principal appropriation from which the cost of providing the services has been paid or will be charged.

6505(d)42:4225.


In the section, the words “executive agency” are substituted for “Federal department or agency” and “department or agency of the executive branch of the Federal Government” because of the definition in sections 102 and 6501(3) of the revised title.
In subsection (a), the source provisions are consolidated to eliminate an unnecessary definition. The word “President” is substituted for “Director of the Office of Management and Budget” in 42:4222(proviso, words after proviso) because sections 101 and 102(a) of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (eff. July 1, 1970, 84 Stat. 2085) designated the Bureau of the Budget as the Office of Management and Budget and transferred all functions of the Bureau to the President. The words “rules and regulations” are omitted as unnecessary.
In subsection (b), the word “may” is substituted for “is authorized within his discretion” for clarity and to omit unnecessary words. The words “specialized or technical services” are omitted because of consolidation of the source provisions. The words “direct or indirect” are omitted as surplus.
In subsection (c), the word “Payment” is substituted for “moneys” for consistency in the section. The words “All” and “or any bureau or other administrative division thereof” are omitted as surplus.
In subsection (d), the words “and does not supersede” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “authority under another law in effect on October 16, 1968” are substituted for “authority now possessed” for clarity. The words “by any Federal department or agency with respect to furnishing services, whether on a reimbursable or nonreimbursable basis, to State and local units of government” are omitted as unnecessary.
