In subsection (b), the words “United States Government” are substituted for “United States or any agency of the United States” for consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsection (c), the words “bring a civil action” are substituted for “sue” for consistency in the revised title. The words “without respect to the amount in controversy” are omitted because section 1331 of title 28 no longer contains a requirement of any particular amount in controversy for jurisdiction of civil actions arising under the laws of the United States. The words “If the person prevails” are added for clarity.
