In subsection (b) the rank, pay, allowances, and privileges of retirement of chiefs of bureaus of the Navy are incorporated. 5 U.S.C. 441 apparently relates the Judge Advocate General of the Navy to the Judge Advocate General of the Army, as well as to bureau chiefs. However, since the creation of the Department of the Air Force by the National Security Act of 1947, if the incorporation to the Army provision is retained, the saving provisions in the act require an incorporation also to the rank, etc., of the Judge Advocate General of the Air Force. The rank of the Judge Advocate General of each of the other departments is now specified in organizational law to be major general. Since it is possible that these ranks may at some future time not be the same, incorporation by reference to them is no longer appropriate. Instead, the section relates the Judge Advocate General’s rank, pay, allowances, and privileges of retirement to those of bureau chiefs as does 5 U.S.C. 441, in part.
In subsection (c), clauses (1) and (4) are substituted for the words “and perform such other duties as have heretofore been performed by the Solicitor and Naval Judge Advocate General” to describe the duties of the Judge Advocate General directly instead of by reference to the duties performed by an officer whose office was abolished more than 75 years ago.
Subsection (c)(2) is substituted for the reference, in 5 U.S.C. 428, to courts-martial and courts of inquiry, since the Uniform Code of Military Justice has superseded prior law as to the duties of the Judge Advocates General relating to these courts.

Amendments2008—Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 110–181 substituted “The Judge Advocate General, while so serving, has the grade of vice admiral or lieutenant general, as appropriate.” for “The Judge Advocate General, while so serving, shall hold a grade not lower than rear admiral or major general, as appropriate.”
2006—Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 109–163, § 1057(a)(2), struck out “or Territory” after “highest court of a State”.
Pub. L. 109–163, § 508(b), substituted “The Judge Advocate General, while so serving, shall hold a grade not lower than rear admiral or major general, as appropriate.” for “If an officer appointed as the Judge Advocate General holds a lower regular grade, the officer shall be appointed in the regular grade of rear admiral or major general, as appropriate.”
2004—Subsec. (e). Pub. L. 108–375 added subsec. (e).
1994—Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 103–337, § 504(b)(1)(A), added last sentence and struck out former last sentence which read as follows: “While so serving, the Judge Advocate General of the Navy shall be entitled to the rank and grade of rear admiral or major general, as appropriate, unless entitled to a higher rank and grade under another provision of law.”
Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 103–337, § 504(b)(1)(B), added subsec. (c) and struck out former subsec. (c) which read as follows: “The Judge Advocate General of the Navy is entitled to the same rank and privileges of retirement as provided for chiefs of bureaus in section 5133 of this title.”
1980—Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 96–513 inserted provision entitling Judge Advocate General of Navy to rank and grade of rear admiral or major general, as appropriate.
1967—Pub. L. 90–179, § 2(1)(A), inserted reference to Judge Advocate General’s Corps in section catchline.
Subsecs. (a) to (d). Pub. L. 90–179, § 2(1)(B), (C), added subsec. (a), redesignated existing subsecs. (a) to (c) as (b) to (d), respectively, and in subsec. (b) as so redesignated substituted “judge advocates” for “officers”.
1962—Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 87–649 struck out “, pay, allowances,” after “same rank”. See Title 37, Pay and Allowances of the Uniformed Services.

Effective Date of 1980 AmendmentAmendment by Pub. L. 96–513 effective Sept. 15, 1981, but the authority to prescribe regulations under the amendment by Pub. L. 96–513 effective on Dec. 12, 1980, see section 701 of Pub. L. 96–513, set out as a note under section 101 of this title.
