Historical and Revision Notes

696934 U.S.C. 1091a.Feb. 14, 1931, ch. 184, 46 Stat. 1111; July 17, 1953, ch. 226, § 2, 67 Stat. 181.


In subsection (a) the words “of the Navy” are supplied since the requirement that the distribution in ratings be similar to that in the United States Navy Band indicates that the Naval Academy Band should not include members of the Marine Corps, and it is so interpreted.
In subsection (b) the words “an officer in the grade of warrant officer, W–1,” are substituted for the words “a warrant officer” because the Warrant Officer Act of 1954 established the grade of warrant officer, W–1, in lieu of all the former warrant officer (as distinguished from commissioned warrant officer) grades. The second sentence covers that part of the second proviso which relates to pay and makes reference to the Career Compensation Act of 1949, since it is that Act which governs entitlement to basic pay and the computation of cumulative years of creditable service. Retirement rights and reenlistment bonuses referred to in the second proviso are covered in the third sentence of this subsection, giving recognition to the fact that the status of the members who are assigned as leader and second leader of the band remains unchanged in these respects.

Amendments1962—Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 87–649 repealed first and second sentences which related to pay and allowances for the leader and second leader of the Naval Academy Band, and to crediting of service for pay purposes. See sections 207 and 424 of Title 37, Pay and Allowances of the Uniformed Services.
