No such exemption may be granted if the Commission finds that such provision of State law, or rule or regulation—(1) is required by any authority of Federal law, or

(2) is designed to protect public health, safety, or welfare, or the environment or conserve energy or is designed to mitigate the effects of emergencies resulting from fuel shortages.
