Reference to a person who “aids in building or fitting out any vessel” was omitted as unnecessary in view of section 2 making all aiders guilty as principal.
Changes in phraseology were made.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $10,000” in last par.
