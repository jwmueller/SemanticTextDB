(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 509; Sept. 3, 1954, ch. 1263, § 32, 68 Stat. 1238; Pub. L. 86–474, § 1(9), May 14, 1960, 74 Stat. 145; Pub. L. 89–444, § 1(9), June 9, 1966, 80 Stat. 195; Pub. L. 94–546, § 1(14), Oct. 18, 1976, 90 Stat. 2520.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 15d (Apr. 16, 1937, ch. 107, § 3, 50 Stat. 67; May 2, 1942, ch. 273, 56 Stat. 265).
The last sentence is new and is inserted to permit adjustment of the work load and leave schedule of Academy faculty members due to the peculiarity of the academic schedule.
The last sentence of this section is new, being included in order to allow for adjusting the working time and leave of civilian instructors in conformity with the academic terms at the Academy. The work load of an instructor varies greatly, and flexibility in administration of a faculty is therefore essential. The leave provided for civil service employees does not fit the needs of an instruction staff, and this has been a source of difficulty in the past. This new provision would permit leave during the summer and between academic terms without deduction from pay, and, it is contemplated, at no other time.
Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.
