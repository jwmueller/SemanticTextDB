(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 700; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(K), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on sections 581 and 592 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking (R.S. §§ 5187, 5209; Sept. 26, 1918, ch. 177, § 7, 40 Stat. 972; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, § 316, 49 Stat. 712).
This section consolidates section 581 and part of section 592 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking.
The punishment provision was drawn from said section 592 as being the latest expression of congressional intent, in preference to the provision of said section 581 which authorized a fine “not more than double the amount so countersigned and delivered and imprisonment not more than 15 years”.
The words “shall be guilty of a misdemeanor” were omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of misdemeanor in section 1 of this title.
Likewise the words “upon conviction in any district court of the United States” were omitted as unnecessary since punishment can follow only after conviction.
(See reviser’s note under section 656 of this title for statement of reasons for dividing said section 592 into three revised sections, with consequent changes in phraseology, style, and arrangement.)

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000”.
