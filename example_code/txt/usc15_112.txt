The average fiber diameter may be subject to a coefficient of variation around the mean that shall not exceed 24 percent.


(b) Additional informationIn addition to information required in this section, the stamp, tag, label, or other means of identification, or substitute therefor under section 68c of this title, may contain other information not violating the provisions of this subchapter or the rules and regulations of the Commission.

(d) Designations on linings, paddings, etc.This section shall not be construed as requiring designation on garments or articles of apparel of fiber content of any linings, paddings, stiffening, trimmings, or facings, except those concerning which express or implied representations of fiber content are customarily made, nor as requiring designation of fiber content of products which have an insignificant or inconsequential textile content: Provided, That if any such article or product purports to contain or in any manner is represented as containing wool, this section shall be applicable thereto and the information required shall be separately set forth and segregated.
The Commission, after giving due notice and opportunity to be heard to interested persons, may determine and publicly announce the classes of such articles concerning which express or implied representations of fiber content are customarily made, and those products which have an insignificant or inconsequential textile content.
