4685(a)50:62a (1st par. and proviso of last par.).June 30, 1906, ch. 3938, 34 Stat. 817.
4685(b)50:62a (last par., less proviso).


In subsection (a), the words “at his discretion” and “as may be available” are omitted as surplusage. The word “lend” is substituted for the word “issue” to reflect the intent of the section. 50:62a (1st 13 words of proviso) is omitted as surplusage. The words “and which is still in effect” are inserted for clarity.
In subsection (b), the words “to the United States” are omitted as surplusage. The words “except property properly expended” are inserted for clarity.
The words “subject to such regulations as he may prescribe” are omitted, since the Secretary has inherent authority to issue regulations appropriate to exercising his statutory functions. The words “to any of the ‘National Homes for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers’ already established or hereafter established and”, in the Act of February 8, 1889, ch. 116, 25 Stat. 657, are not contained in 50:66 (1st sentence). They are also omitted from the revised section, since the National Homes for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers were dissolved by the Act of July 3, 1930, ch. 863, 46 Stat. 1016. The Acts of March 3, 1899, ch. 643 (1st proviso under “Ordnance Department”), 30 Stat. 1073; and May 26, 1900, ch. 586 (1st proviso under “Ordnance Department”), 31 Stat. 216, as amended, relating to disposal of ordnance to “Homes for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers” by the Chief of Ordnance, became inoperative when the Homes were dissolved. Although section 402(e) of the Army Organization Act of 1950, ch. 383, 64 Stat. 273, amended the Act of May 26, 1900, it did not have the effect of reviving that act. The word “give” is substituted for the word “deliver” to express more clearly the intent of the section. The words “serviceable” and “as may be on hand undisposed of” are omitted as surplusage. The word “may” is substituted for the words “is authorized and directed”, since section 4684 of this title provides an alternative method for the disposal of obsolete cannon.

Amendments2006—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 109–163 substituted “State concerned or Guam or the Virgin Islands” for “State or Territory concerned” and “State, Guam, and the Virgin Islands” for “State and Territorial”.
