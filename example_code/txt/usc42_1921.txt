References in TextSection 1395w–101(a)(3) of this title, referred to in subsec. (a)(4), (8), (9), was in the original “section 1860D–1(a)(4)”, and was translated as meaning section 1860D–1(a)(3) of act Aug. 14, 1935, which is classified to section 1395w–101(a)(3) of this title, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because section 1395w–101(a) of this title does not contain a par.
