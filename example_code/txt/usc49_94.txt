The words “civil action” are substituted for “proceedings . . . begun originally in any court of the United States” for consistency with rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.). The words “section 1132, 1134(b) or (f)(1) (related to an aircraft accident), or 1155(a) of this title” are substituted for “the provisions of this chapter” in 49 App.:1489 because 49 App.:1489 is taken from 49 App.:ch. 20 and the sections in quotations restate the relevant provisions of 49 App.:ch. 20 carried out by the National Transportation Safety Board. The remaining relevant provisions of 49 App.:ch. 20 are restated in part A of subtitle VII of the revised title, and provisions comparable to this section are included as section 46109 of the revised title. The word “rule” is omitted as being synonymous with “regulation”. The word “requirement” is omitted as included in “order”. The words “or any term, condition, or limitation of any certificate or permit” are omitted because the Board does not have authority to issue certificates or permits. The words “may be joined as a party or permitted to intervene” are substituted for “it shall be lawful to include as parties, or to permit the intervention of” for clarity. The text of 49 App.:1489 (words after semicolon) is omitted as surplus.
