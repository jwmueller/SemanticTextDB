(c) The Secretary may sell serviceable quartermaster property, other than subsistence supplies, to an officer of another armed force for his use in the service, in the same manner as these articles are sold to an officer of the Air Force.

(d) A person who has been discharged honorably or under honorable conditions from the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps and who is receiving care and medical treatment from the Public Health Service or the Department of Veterans Affairs may buy subsistence supplies and other supplies, except articles of uniform, at the prices at which like property is sold to a member of the Air Force.

In subsection (a), the word “members” is substituted for the words “officers and enlisted men”, in 10:1237. Clause (2) is substituted for 10:904. Reference to the Secretary of the Air Force is substituted for reference to branch, office, or officers of the Army, in 10:1237, since the functions which, for the Army are assigned to subordinate officers, are, for the Air Force assigned to the Secretary of the Air Force. 32:156 is omitted as covered by 10:904, since the words “officers of the Air Force” necessarily cover all persons named in 32:156. The words “Except for articles and items acquired through the use of working capital funds under sections 172–172j of title 5” are inserted to reflect Title IV of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (63 Stat. 585), which authorized the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations governing the use and sale of certain inventories at cost, including applicable administrative expenses. (See opinion of the Assistant General Counsel (Fiscal Matters) of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, January 4, 1955.)
In subsection (b), the first sentence states expressly the rule which is implicit in 10:1238. The word “members” is substituted for the words “officers and enlisted men”. The words “shall be understood, in all cases of such sales” are omitted as surplusage. The last sentence is inserted to reflect Title IV of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (63 Stat. 585), which authorized the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations governing the use and sale of certain inventories at cost, including applicable administrative expenses. (See opinion of the Deputy General Counsel of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, March 28, 1956.)
In subsection (c), the word “members” is substituted for the words “officers and enlisted men”. The words “prices at which like property is sold to” are substituted for the words “same price as is charged the”.
In subsections (c) and (d), the words “other armed forces” are substituted for the words “Navy and Marine Corps”, since such sales are authorized to members of the Coast Guard by section 144(b) of Title 14.
In subsection (d), the words “other than subsistence supplies” are inserted, since the sale of subsistence supplies is covered by subsection (c).
In subsection (e), the words “a person who has been discharged” are substituted for the words “discharged officers and enlisted men”. The words “Navy * * * or Marine Corps”, omitted from the 1952 edition of the United States Code, are inserted to conform to the source statute. The words “may buy” are substituted for the words “shall * * * be permitted to purchase”. The words “at the prices at which like property is sold” are substituted for the words “at the same price as charged”. The word “member” is substituted for the words “officers and enlisted men”. The words “while undergoing such care and treatment” are omitted as surplusage.
In subsection (f), the words “person who has been discharged” are substituted for the words “former members * * * who have been separated therefrom”. The words “at the prices at which like articles are sold to members” are inserted to conform to the last sentence of subsection (a) and subsection (e).
In subsection (g), the words “regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary” are substituted for the words “Army Regulations”. The words “of the Government” are omitted as surplusage. 10:1253 (last 22 words of 1st sentence) is omitted as surplusage. The words “or to another executive department of the Government” are omitted as superseded by section 7 of the act of May 21, 1920, ch. 194, as amended (31 U.S.C. 686). The provisions of 10:1253 relating to the computation of cost are omitted to reflect Title IV of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (63 Stat. 585), which authorized the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations governing the use and sale of certain inventories at cost, including applicable administrative expenses. (See opinion of the Assistant General Counsel (Fiscal Matters) of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, January 4, 1955.)
In subsection (h), the word “outside” is substituted for the words “beyond the continental limitations”. The words “or in Alaska” are omitted, since, under section 101(1) of this title, the words “United States” are defined to include only the States and the District of Columbia. The word “continental”, after the words “within the”, is omitted for the same reason. The last sentence is substituted for 10:1241 (proviso).
In subsection (i), 10:1196 (last 30 words) is omitted as superseded by the Act of April 27, 1914, ch. 72 (last proviso under “Subsistence of the Army”), 38 Stat. 361. The words “So much of the” and “as may be necessary” are omitted as surplusage. The words “members * * * on active duty, for the use of themselves and their families” are substituted for the words “officers for the use of themselves and their families, and to commanders of companies or other organizations, for the use of the enlisted men of their companies or organizations”, to conform to 10:1237 and 1238. Those sections provide the basic authority for procurement and sale of subsistence supplies to all members. This interpretation conforms to established administrative practice under those sections. The word “supplies” is substituted for the word “stores”.

1962 ActThe change corrects an internal reference.
