(2) increase competition by new entrant air carriers or in multiple markets;

The Secretary shall consider the extent to which the exemptions will—(A) provide air transportation with domestic network benefits in areas beyond the perimeter described in section 49109;

(B) increase competition in multiple markets;

(C) not reduce travel options for communities served by small hub airports and medium hub airports within the perimeter described in section 49109;

(5) Conditions.—Beyond-perimeter flight operations carried out by an air carrier using an exemption granted under this subsection shall be subject to the following conditions:(A) An air carrier may not operate a multi-aisle or widebody aircraft in conducting such operations.

(B) An air carrier granted an exemption under this subsection is prohibited from transferring the rights to its beyond-perimeter exemptions pursuant to section 41714(j).



(h) Scheduling Priority.—In administering this section, the Secretary shall—(1) afford a scheduling priority to operations conducted by new entrant air carriers and limited incumbent air carriers over operations conducted by other air carriers granted additional slot exemptions under subsection (g) for service to airports located beyond the perimeter described in section 49109;
