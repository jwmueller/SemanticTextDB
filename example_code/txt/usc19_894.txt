FindingsPub. L. 111–171, § 2, May 24, 2010, 124 Stat. 1194, provided that: 
“Congress finds the following:
“(1) On January 12, 2010, Haiti was hit by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake, the worst earthquake to affect Haiti in recorded history. Aftershocks from the earthquake, measuring up to 6.0 on the Richter scale, continued for days afterwards.

“(2) The earthquake has devastated Haiti’s infrastructure, including homes, offices, factories, roads, ports, communications, and other facilities. The loss of life attributable to the earthquake was massive.

“(3) Even before the earthquake, Haiti was the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, ranking 149 out of 182 countries according to the United Nation’s Human Development Index.

“(4) In recent years, however, the Government and people of Haiti had taken important steps forward to promote economic growth and development, including making strides towards establishing a competitive apparel sector.

“(5) United States trade preference programs, including the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act [19 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.] (as amended by the United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act [Pub. L. 106–200, title II, see Tables for classification], the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2006 [Pub. L. 109–432, div. D, title V, see Tables for classification], and the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2008 [Pub. L. 110–234, title XV, subtitle D, part I, and Pub. L. 110–246, title XV, subtitle D, part I, see Tables for classification]), which extend duty-free tariff treatment to certain apparel produced in Haiti, have made an important contribution to Haiti’s economic development efforts.

“(6) However, the Haitian apparel sector has been hard hit by the January 12, 2010, earthquake. A number of apparel factories based in and around Port-au-Prince have been heavily damaged, including the collapse of one major apparel factory that had employed nearly 4,000 workers.

“(7) The Port-au-Prince seaport that had served the apparel trade has been badly damaged. And extensive damage to roads has made it difficult to transport apparel to the Dominican Republic for shipment from ports in that country.

“(8) According to estimates by the Department of Commerce, imports of apparel articles from Haiti to the United States in 2010 have decreased by 43 percent as compared to the same period in 2009.

“(9) The earthquake has increased significantly the costs and uncertainty of doing business in Haiti. A strong and unequivocal commitment from the United States is needed to help Haiti offset these costs and preserve the gains made under United States trade preference programs, and to encourage buyers and investors to stand with Haiti through this crisis.”




Customs Support ServicesPub. L. 111–171, § 9, May 24, 2010, 124 Stat. 1205, provided that:
“(a) In General.—“(1) Rapid response team.—The Commissioner responsible for United States Customs and Border Protection (in this section referred to as the ‘Commissioner’) shall, in consultation with the United States Coast Guard, the Drug Enforcement Agency, and other Federal agencies, as appropriate, seek to send a rapid response team to Haiti—“(A) to assess the short-term and long-term technical, capacity-building, and training needs of the authorities of the Government of Haiti responsible for customs services; and

“(B) a multi-year plan for supplying technical, capacity-building, and training assistance to those authorities, including specific responsibilities to be undertaken by the support team authorized by subsection (b); and

“(C) a statement of the amount and purpose for which any funds were expended by the rapid response team in Haiti to administer the provisions of this section, including any expenditure of funds authorized to be appropriated pursuant to subsection (c)(1).



“(b) Support Team.—“(1) In general.—The Commissioner shall, in consultation with other Federal agencies, as appropriate, seek to establish a support team in Haiti for the purpose of helping to meet the short-term and long-term technical, capacity-building, and training needs of the authorities of the Government of Haiti responsible for customs services, as described in this section.

“(2) Termination.—The support team authorized by paragraph (1) shall terminate on September 30, 2020.

“(B) $750,000 for each of the fiscal years 2011 through 2020 for the purpose of maintaining the support team authorized by subsection (b).


“(2) Supplement and not supplant.—The amounts authorized to be appropriated by paragraph (1) shall supplement and not supplant any other funds authorized to be appropriated to the Department of Homeland Security.”
