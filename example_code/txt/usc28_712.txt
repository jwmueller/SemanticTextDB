§ 2322. United States as party
All actions specified in section 2321 of this title shall be brought by or against the United States.
(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 969.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 48 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 211, 36 Stat. 1150; Oct. 22, 1913, ch. 32, 38 Stat. 219).
Word “actions” was substituted for “cases and proceedings”, in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
A provision authorizing intervention by the United States was omitted. The United States, under the provisions of this section, is a necessary and indispensable original party, and hence intervention is unnecessary. (See Lambert Run Coal Co. v. Baltimore &amp; O. R. Co., 1922, 42 S.Ct. 349, 258 U.S. 377, 66 L.Ed. 671.)
