(e) Proceedings and findings; extension of charters(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 11 and 14 of this Act, as amended [sections 1744 and 1735 note of this Appendix], war-built dry-cargo vessels owned by the United States on or after June 30, 1950, may be chartered pursuant to this Act [sections 1735 to 1746 of this Appendix] for bareboat use in any service which, in the opinion of the Maritime Administration, is required in the public interest and is not adequately served, and for which privately owned American flag vessels are not available for charter by private operators on reasonable conditions and at reasonable rates for use in such service. No charters shall be made by the Secretary of Transportation under authority of this subsection until the Maritime Administration shall have given due notice to all interested parties and shall have afforded such parties an opportunity for a public hearing on such charters and shall have certified its findings to the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to include in such charters such restrictions and conditions as the Maritime Administration determines to be necessary or appropriate to protect the public interest in respect of such charters and to protect privately owned vessels against competition from vessels chartered under this section: Provided, however, That all such charters shall contain a provision that they will be reviewed annually by the Maritime Administration, with recommendations to the Secretary of Transportation, for the purpose of determining whether conditions exist justifying continuance of the charters under the provisions of this subsection.

(2) A charter existing on June 30, 1950, with respect to a war-built dry-cargo vessel may be extended to October 31, 1950, if application is made within ten days after the enactment hereof [June 30, 1950] for the charter of such vessel under this subsection and if the Secretary of Transportation deems such extension is justified in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection: Provided, however, That a new voyage under such extended charter shall not be begun after October 31, 1950, unless it has been determined prior to such date, in accordance with the procedure set forth in this subsection, that the continued use of the vessel in the service is required. The Maritime Administration shall conduct all hearings on applications made under this paragraph immediately upon receipt thereof and shall promptly certify its findings to the Secretary of Transportation, provided that all such certifications shall be made not later than October 31, 1950.


(f) Charter of passenger vessels(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 11 and 14 of this Act, as amended [sections 1744 and 1735 note of this Appendix], the Secretary of Transportation may charter any passenger vessel, whether or not war-built, owned by the United States on or after June 30, 1950, pursuant to chapter 575 of title 46, and may charter any war-built passenger vessel owned by the United States for use in the domestic trade of the United States, under the conditions prescribed for the charter of war-built cargo vessels in subsection (e) of this section.

(2) Charters existing on June 30, 1950, with respect to passenger vessels may be continued until December 31, 1951, or until expiration thereof by the terms of their provisions.
