(B) the purpose of entering into or issuing such obligation is the financing of any energy conservation measure or renewable-resource energy measure which is to be installed or otherwise implemented in any building or industrial plant owned or operated by the person or State, political subdivision of a State, or agency or instrumentality of either a State or political subdivision thereof, (i) which enters into or issues such obligation, or (ii) to which such measure is leased.


(2) No guarantee or commitment to guarantee may be issued under this subsection with respect to any obligation—(A) which is a general obligation of a State; or

(B) which is entered into or issued for the purpose of financing any energy conservation measure or renewable-resource energy measure which is to be installed or otherwise implemented in a residential building containing 2 or fewer dwelling units.


(3) Before prescribing rules pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary shall consult with the Administrator of the Small Business Administration in order to formulate procedures which would assist small business concerns in obtaining guarantees and commitments to guarantee under this section.


(b) Preconditions for issuance of guarantees and commitments to guaranteeNo obligation may be guaranteed, and no commitment to guarantee an obligation may be issued, under subsection (a) of this section, unless the Secretary finds that the measure which is to be financed by such obligation—(1) has been identified by an energy audit to be an energy conservation measure or a renewable-resource energy measure; or

(2) is included on a list of energy conservation measures and renewable-resource energy measures which the Secretary publishes under section 6325(e)(1) of this title.


Before issuing a guarantee under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may require that an energy audit be conducted with respect to an energy conservation measure or a renewable-resource energy measure which is on a list described in paragraph (2) and which is to be financed by the obligation to be guaranteed under this section. The amount of any obligation which may be guaranteed under subsection (a) of this section may include the cost of an energy audit.

(c) Limitations on availability of guarantees; term of guarantees; aggregate outstanding principal amount of obligations of one borrower(1) The Secretary shall limit the availability of a guarantee otherwise authorized by subsection (a) of this section to obligations entered into by or issued by borrowers who can demonstrate that financing is not otherwise available on reasonable terms and conditions to allow the measure to be financed.

(2) No obligation may be guaranteed by the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section unless the Secretary finds—(A) there is a reasonable prospect for the repayment of such obligation; and

No guarantee issued, and no commitment to guarantee, which is issued under subsection (a) of this section shall be terminated, canceled, or otherwise revoked except in accordance with reasonable terms and conditions prescribed by the Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, and contained in the written guarantee or commitment to guarantee. The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all guarantees made under subsection (a) of this section.

Any amount collected under this paragraph shall be deposited in the miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury.


(f) Default in payment of principal due under guaranteed obligation; procedures applicable(1) If there is a default by the obligor in any payment of principal due under an obligation guaranteed under subsection (a) of this section, and if such default continues for 30 days, the holder of such obligation or his agent has the right to demand payment by the Secretary of the unpaid principal of such obligation, consistent with the terms of the guarantee of such obligation. Such payment may be demanded within such period as may be specified in the guarantee or related agreements, which period shall expire not later than 90 days from the date of such default. If demand occurs within such specified period, then not later than 60 days from the date of such demand, the Secretary shall pay to such holder the unpaid principal of such obligation, consistent with the terms of the guarantee of such obligation; except that (A) the Secretary shall not be required to make any such payment if he finds, prior to the expiration of the 60-day period beginning on the date on which the demand is made, that there was no default by the obligor in the payment of principal or that such default has been remedied, and (B) no such holder shall receive payment or be entitled to retain payment in a total amount which together with any other recovery (including any recovery based upon any security interest) exceeds the actual loss of principal by such holder.

The terms of any such sale or other disposition shall be as approved by the Secretary.

(4) If there is a default by the obligor in any payment due under an obligation guaranteed under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall take such action against such obligor or any other person as is, in his discretion, necessary or appropriate to protect the interests of the United States. Such an action may be brought in the name of the United States or in the name of the holder of such obligation. Such holder shall make available to the Secretary all records and evidence necessary to prosecute any such suit. The Secretary may, in his discretion, accept a conveyance of property in full or partial satisfaction of any sums owed to him.
