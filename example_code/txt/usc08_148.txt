Beginning not later than December 31, 2006, the number of airports selected for an assignment under this subsection shall be at least 50.

“(a) Findings.—Consistent with the report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Congress makes the following findings:“(1) The exchange of terrorist information with other countries, consistent with privacy requirements, along with listings of lost and stolen passports, will have immediate security benefits.

“(2) The further away from the borders of the United States that screening occurs, the more security benefits the United States will gain.


“(b) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that—“(1) the Federal Government should exchange terrorist information with trusted allies;

“(2) the Federal Government should move toward real-time verification of passports with issuing authorities;

“(3) where practicable, the Federal Government should conduct screening before a passenger departs on a flight destined for the United States;

“(4) the Federal Government should work with other countries to ensure effective inspection regimes at all airports;

“(5) the Federal Government should work with other countries to improve passport standards and provide foreign assistance to countries that need help making the transition to the global standard for identification; and

“(6) the Department of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Department of State and other Federal agencies, should implement the initiatives called for in this subsection.”
