“SEC. 3. MINIMUM DISTANCE SEPARATION REQUIREMENTS.“(a) In General.—The Federal Communications Commission shall modify its rules to eliminate third-adjacent minimum distance separation requirements between—“(1) low-power FM stations; and

“(2) full-service FM stations, FM translator stations, and FM booster stations.


“(b) Restriction.—“(1) In general.—The Federal Communications Commission shall not amend its rules to reduce the minimum co-channel and first- and second-adjacent channel distance separation requirements in effect on the date of enactment of this Act [Jan. 4, 2011] between—“(A) low-power FM stations; and

“(B) full-service FM stations.


“(2) Waiver.—“(A) In general.—Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Federal Communications Commission may grant a waiver of the second-adjacent channel distance separation requirement to low-power FM stations that establish, using methods of predicting interference taking into account all relevant factors, including terrain-sensitive propagation models, that their proposed operations will not result in interference to any authorized radio service.

“(B) Requirements.—“(i) Suspension.—Any low-power FM station that receives a waiver under subparagraph (A) shall be required to suspend operation immediately upon notification by the Federal Communications Commission that it is causing interference to the reception of an existing or modified full-service FM station without regard to the location of the station receiving interference.

“(ii) Elimination of interference.—A low-power FM station described in clause (i) shall not resume operation until such interference has been eliminated or it can demonstrate to the Federal Communications Commission that the interference was not due to emissions from the low-power FM station, except that such station may make short test transmissions during the period of suspended operation to check the efficacy of remedial measures.

“(iii) Notification.—Upon receipt of a complaint of interference from a low-power FM station operating pursuant to a waiver authorized under subparagraph (A), the Federal Communications Commission shall notify the identified low-power FM station by telephone or other electronic communication within 1 business day.
