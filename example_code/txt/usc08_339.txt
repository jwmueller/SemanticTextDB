â€œSec. 105. Whenever the Secretary, after reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing to any State educational agency, finds that there is a failure to meet the requirements of any title of this Act, the Secretary shall notify that agency that further payments will not be made to the agency under such title, or in the discretion of the Secretary, that the State educational agency shall not make further payments under such title to specified local education agencies or other entities (in the case of funds under title IV) whose actions cause or are involved in such failure until the Secretary is satisfied that there is no longer any such failure to comply. Until the Secretary is so satisfied, no further payments shall be made to the State educational agency under such title, or payments by the State educational agency under such title shall be limited to local educational agencies or other entities (in the case of funds under title IV) whose actions did not cause or were not involved in the failure, as the case may be.
