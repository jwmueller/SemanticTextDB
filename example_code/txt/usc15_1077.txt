In subsec. (a), the words “and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia” following “the Courts of Appeal of the United States” have been deleted as superfluous in view of section 41 of Title 28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure, which includes the District of Columbia within the eleven judicial circuits of the United States. The word “and” has been inserted preceding “the courts of appeal of the United States” to preserve the conjunctive sense of the sentence.
