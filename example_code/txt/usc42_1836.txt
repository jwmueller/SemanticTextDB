If the Commissioner of Social Security, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the State agency administering or supervising the administration of the State plan approved under this subchapter, finds—
(1) that the plan has been so changed that it no longer complies with the provisions of section 1332 of this title; or
(2) that in the administration of the plan there is a failure to comply substantially with any such provision;
the Commissioner of Social Security shall notify such State agency that further payments will not be made to the State (or, in the Commissioner’s discretion, that payments will be limited to categories under or parts of the State plan not affected by such failure), until the Commissioner of Social Security is satisfied that there will no longer be any such failure to comply. Until the Commissioner is so satisfied the Commissioner shall make no further payments to such State (or shall limit payments to categories under or parts of the State plan not affected by such failure).
