(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 715; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(K), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 146 (Dec. 11, 1926, ch. 2, § 1, 44 Stat. 917).
References to persons causing, procuring, aiding or assisting were omitted as unnecessary as such persons are made principals by section 2 of this title.
Also, in first paragraph, word “agency” was substituted for “branch”, in view of definitions of department and agency in section 6 of this title.
Words “upon conviction” in last paragraph were omitted as surplusage since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.
Minor changes of phraseology were also made.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000”.
