In this section, the words “greater or less” are omitted as being included in “different”. The words “foreign air transportation” are substituted for “air transportation” because 49 App.:1551(a)(4)(B) provides that 49 App.:1373 no longer applies to interstate or overseas air transportation and 49 App.:1376(a)–(e), restated in section 41901 of the revised title, governs prices for the transportation of mail by aircraft. See section 40102(a) of the revised title defining “air transportation” to mean interstate or foreign air transportation or the transportation of mail by aircraft. The words “for any service in connection therewith” are omitted as surplus because the word “transportation” includes any services related to the transportation.
In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words “may not” are substituted for “no . . . shall” and “no . . . shall, in any manner or by any device, directly or indirectly, or through any agent or broker, or otherwise” for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (1), the words “demand or collect” are omitted as being included in “charge or receive”. The words “then currently” are omitted as surplus. In clause (3), the words “tariff for foreign air transportation” are substituted for “such tariffs” for clarity.
In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words “shipper, consignor, consignee, forwarder, broker, or other . . . or any director, officer, agent, or employee thereof” are omitted as surplus. In clause (1), the words “directly or indirectly, by any device or means” and “currently” are omitted as surplus. In clause (2), before subclause (A), the words “in any manner or by any device, directly or indirectly, through any agent or broker, or otherwise” are omitted as surplus. In subclause (B), the word “favor” is omitted as surplus.
