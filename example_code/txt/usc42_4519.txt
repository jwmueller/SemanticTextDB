(h) Payments; revolving loan fund: establishment in private financial institution for rehabilitation activities; standards for payments: criteria(1) Units of general local government receiving assistance under this chapter may receive funds, in one payment, in an amount not to exceed the total amount designated in the grant (or, in the case of a unit of general local government receiving a distribution from a State pursuant to section 5306(d) of this title, not to exceed the total amount of such distribution) for use in establishing a revolving loan fund which is to be established in a private financial institution and which is to be used to finance rehabilitation activities assisted under this chapter. Rehabilitation activities authorized under this section shall begin within 45 days after receipt of such payment and substantial disbursements from such fund must begin within 180 days after receipt of such payment.

(2) The Secretary shall establish standards for such cash payments which will insure that the deposits result in appropriate benefits in support of the recipient’s rehabilitation program. These standards shall be designed to assure that the benefits to be derived from the local program include, at a minimum, one or more of the following elements, or such other criteria as determined by the Secretary—(A) leverage of community development block grant funds so that participating financial institutions commit private funds for loans in the rehabilitation program in amounts substantially in excess of deposit of community development funds;

A State may require as a condition of any amount distributed by such State under section 5306(d) of this title that a unit of general local government shall pay to such State any such income to be used by such State to fund additional eligible community development activities, except that such State shall waive such condition to the extent such income is applied to continue the activity from which such income was derived.
