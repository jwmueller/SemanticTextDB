§ 10301. Congressional findings and declarations
The Congress finds and declares that—(1) the existence of an adequate supply of water of good quality for the production of materials and energy for the Nation’s needs and for the efficient use of the Nation’s energy and water resources is essential to national economic stability and growth, and to the well-being of the people;

(2) the management of water resources is closely related to maintaining environmental quality, productivity of natural resources and agricultural systems, and social well-being;

(3) there is an increasing threat of impairment to the quantity and quality of surface and groundwater resources;

(4) the Nation’s capabilities for technological assessment and planning and for policy formulation for water resources must be strengthened at the Federal, State, and local governmental levels;

(5) there should be a continuing national investment in water and related research and technology commensurate with growing national needs;

(6) it is necessary to provide for the research and development of technology for the conversion of saline and other impaired waters to a quality suitable for municipal, industrial, agricultural, recreational, and other beneficial uses;

(7) the Nation must provide programs to strengthen research and associated graduate education because the pool of scientists, engineers, and technicians trained in fields related to water resources constitutes an invaluable natural resource which should be increased, fully utilized, and regularly replenished; and 11 So in original. The word “and” probably should not appear.

(8) long-term planning and policy development are essential to ensure the availability of an abundant supply of high quality water for domestic and other uses; and

(9) the States must have the research and problem-solving capacity necessary to effectively manage their water resources.

More Water, More Energy, and Less WastePub. L. 110–229, title V, § 514, May 8, 2008, 122 Stat. 844, provided that:
“(a) Findings.—The Congress finds that—“(1) development of energy resources, including oil, natural gas, coalbed methane, and geothermal resources, frequently results in bringing to the surface water extracted from underground sources;

“(2) some of that produced water is used for irrigation or other purposes, but most of the water is returned to the subsurface or otherwise disposed of as waste;

“(3) reducing the quantity of produced water returned to the subsurface and increasing the quantity of produced water that is made available for irrigation and other uses—“(A) would augment water supplies;

“(B) could reduce the costs to energy developers for disposing of the water; and

“(C) in some cases, could increase the efficiency of energy development activities; and


“(4) it is in the national interest—“(A) to limit the quantity of produced water disposed of as waste;

“(B) to optimize the production of energy resources; and

“(C) to remove or reduce obstacles to use of produced water for irrigation or other purposes in ways that will not adversely affect water quality or the environment.



“(b) Purposes.—The purposes of this section are—“(1) to optimize the production of energy resources—“(A) by minimizing the quantity of produced water; and

“(B) by facilitating the use of produced water for irrigation and other purposes without adversely affecting water quality or the environment; and


“(2) to demonstrate means of accomplishing those results.


“(c) Definitions.—In this section:“(1) Lower basin state.—The term ‘Lower Basin State’ means any of the States of—“(A) Arizona;
