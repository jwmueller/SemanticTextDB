6323(a), (b)34 U.S.C. 410b.Feb. 21, 1946, ch. 34, § 6, 60 Stat. 27.
6323(c)34 U.S.C. 410b–1.Apr. 14, 1949, ch. 52, § 1 (less applicability to Act of June 29, 1948, ch. 708, § 301(b), 62 Stat. 1087), 63 Stat. 47.


In subsection (b) the words “or the Reserve Components thereof” are omitted because the terms “Navy”, “Marine Corps”, and “Coast Guard” include the reserve components. The words “including active duty for training” are omitted because the term “active duty” is defined in this title as including training duty.
The Act of April 14, 1949 (34 U.S.C. 410b–1), extending the benefits of 34 U.S.C. 410b to officers on the honorary retired lists, was enacted because the Comptroller General had held that these officers, being already in a retired status, could not be retired under 34 U.S.C. 410b (U.S. Code Congressional Service, 1949, p. 1179). The provisions of the Naval Reserve Act of 1938 relating to the honorary retired lists were repealed by § 803 of the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952, but insofar as they provided for retirement and retired pay they were reenacted, for a period of 20 years, in § 413 of that act (50 U.S.C. 1052). Persons on the honorary retired lists when the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952 was passed were transferred to the appropriate Retired Reserve under § 213 of the Act. Persons qualifying for retirement under § 413 are likewise placed in the Retired Reserve. The purpose of Congress in enacting § 413 was to preserve the accrued rights of persons who were members of reserve components on January 1, 1953, the effective date of the Act (U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News, 1952, p. 3584). One of their rights was the right to apply for retirement under 34 U.S.C. 410b upon completion of the required service, notwithstanding the fact that, before qualifying for retirement under that section, they had already acquired a retired status. Subsection (c) is worded accordingly.

6323(c), (e)[No source].[No source].
6323(d)[No source].[No source].
6323(f)[No source].[No source].


In subsection (b), the words “armed forces” are substituted for the words “Navy, Marine Corps, Army, Air Force, or Coast Guard, or the Reserve Components thereof” because “armed forces”, as defined in this title, is a collective term for these elements.
Subsections (c) and (e) state rules, formerly stated in section 6325, with respect to officers retired under this section.
Subsection (d) states a rule, formerly stated in section 6325, with respect to warrant officers retired under this section.
In subsections (c) and (e), the words “Unless otherwise entitled to a higher grade” and “Unless otherwise entitled to higher pay” are substituted for 34 App.:410c(b).
In subsection (d), the second and third provisos of 34 App.:410b, relating to officers whose basic pay is not based on years of service, is omitted as obsolete. Under the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37 U.S.C. 231 et seq.), the basic pay of all officers is based on years of service. The subsection is worded to conform to the terminology of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 and to make clear the fact that the amount of retired pay is not permanently fixed at the time of retirement but is subject to change when rates of basic pay are changed, as provided in 34 App.:410q.
Subsection (f) was formerly subsection (c).
