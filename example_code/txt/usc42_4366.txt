Congressional FindingsPub. L. 102–586, § 9(a), Nov. 4, 1992, 106 Stat. 5036, provided that: 
“The Congress finds that—
“(1) circumstances surrounding the death of a young boy named Adam Mann in New York City prompted a shocking documentary focusing on the inability of child protection services to protect suffering children;

“(2) the documentary described in paragraph (1) showed the serious need for systemic changes in our child welfare protection system;

“(3) thorough, coordinated, and comprehensive investigation will, it is hoped, lead to the prevention of abuse, neglect, or death in the future;

“(4) an undue burden is placed on investigation due to strict Federal and State laws and regulations regarding confidentiality;

“(5) while the Congress recognizes the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of records pertaining to child abuse, neglect, and death, often the purpose of confidentiality laws and regulations are [sic] defeated when they have the effect of protecting those responsible;

“(6) comprehensive and coordinated interagency communication needs to be established, with adequate provisions to protect against the public disclosure of any detrimental information need to be established [sic];

“(7) certain States, including Georgia, North Carolina, California, Missouri, Arizona, Minnesota, Oklahoma, and Oregon, have taken steps to establish by statute interagency, multidisciplinary fatality review teams to fully investigate incidents of death believed to be caused by child abuse or neglect;

“(8) teams such as those described in paragraph (7) should be established in every State, and their scope of review should be expanded to include egregious incidents of child abuse and neglect before the child in question dies; and

“(9) teams such as those described in paragraph (7) will increase the accountability of child protection services.”
