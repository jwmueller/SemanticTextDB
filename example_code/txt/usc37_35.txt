(2) A commissioned medical officer in the Regular or Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service (other than an officer serving in the Indian Health Service) may not receive additional special pay under section 302(a)(4) of this title for any period during which the officer is providing obligated service under the following provisions of law:(A) Section 338B of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254l–1).

(B) The Secretary concerned may establish, by regulations, procedures for determining the amount of the repayment required under this subsection and the circumstances under which an exception to the required repayment may be granted. The Secretary concerned may specify in the regulations the conditions under which an installment payment of a bonus or similar benefit to be paid to a member of the uniformed services will not be made if the member no longer satisfies the eligibility requirements for the bonus or similar benefit. For the military departments, this subsection shall be administered under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.

(ii) may grant an exception to the requirement to terminate the payment of any unpaid amounts of a bonus, incentive pay, or similar benefit if the Secretary concerned determines that termination of the payment of the unpaid amounts would be contrary to a personnel policy or management objective, would be against equity and good conscience, or would be contrary to the best interests of the United States.


(B) In this paragraph, the term “sole survivorship discharge” means the separation of a member from the Armed Forces, at the request of the member, pursuant to the Department of Defense policy permitting the early separation of a member who is the only surviving child in a family in which—(i) the father or mother or one or more siblings—(I) served in the Armed Forces; and

(II) was killed, died as a result of wounds, accident, or disease, is in a captured or missing in action status, or is permanently 100 percent disabled or hospitalized on a continuing basis (and is not employed gainfully because of the disability or hospitalization); and


(ii) the death, status, or disability did not result from the intentional misconduct or willful neglect of the parent or sibling and was not incurred during a period of unauthorized absence.



(3)(A) If a member of the uniformed services dies or is retired or separated with a combat-related disability, the Secretary concerned—(i) shall not require repayment by the member or the member’s estate of the unearned portion of any bonus or similar benefit previously paid to the member; and

(ii) shall require the payment to the member or the member’s estate of the remainder of any bonus or similar benefit that was not yet paid to the member, but to which the member was entitled immediately before the death, retirement, or separation of the member, and would be paid if not for the death, retirement, or separation of the member.


(B) Subparagraph (A) does not apply if the death or disability of the member is the result of the member’s misconduct.

(C) The amount to be paid under subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be equal to the full amount specified by the agreement or contract applicable to the bonus or similar benefit as if the member continued to be entitled to the bonus or similar benefit following the death, retirement, or separation.

(D) Amounts to be paid to a member or the member’s estate under subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be paid in a lump sum not later than 90 days after the date of the death, retirement, or separation of the member, whichever applies.

(4) An obligation to repay the United States under this subsection is, for all purposes, a debt owed the United States. A discharge in bankruptcy under title 11 does not discharge a person from such debt if the discharge order is entered less than five years after—(A) the date of the termination of the agreement or contract on which the debt is based; or

(B) in the absence of such an agreement or contract, the date of the termination of the service on which the debt is based.


(5) In this subsection:(A) The term “bonus or similar benefit” means a bonus, incentive pay, special pay, or similar payment, or an educational benefit or stipend, paid to a member of the uniformed services under a provision of law that refers to the repayment requirements of this subsection.

(B) The term “service”, as used in paragraph (4)(B), refers to an obligation willingly undertaken by a member of the uniformed services, in exchange for a bonus or similar benefit offered by the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary concerned—(i) to remain on active duty or in an active status in a reserve component;
