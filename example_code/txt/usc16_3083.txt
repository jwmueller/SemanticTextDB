Codification
Words “in the Wichita National Forest and in the Grand Canyon National Forest” inserted, and “Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Agriculture, respectively” substituted for “Secretary of Agriculture” because of Reorg. Plan No. II of 1939, which transferred Bureau of Biological Survey from Department of Agriculture to Department of the Interior. The successor to Wichita National Forest, which was then administered by that Bureau, was affected by the transfer. However, the successor to Grand Canyon National Forest was administered by Forest Service and was consequently not affected.
For successors to Wichita National Forest and Grand Canyon National Forest, see Presidential Designation note set out under section 684 of this title.
