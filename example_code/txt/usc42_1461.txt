“(2) one or more persons became entitled to monthly benefits before January 1968 under section 202(d) of such Act [42 U.S.C. 402(d)] by reason of section 216(h)(3) of such Act [42 U.S.C. 416(h)(3)] (but without regard to section 202(j)(1)), on the basis of such wages and self-employment income and are so entitled for January 1968, and
