(ii) which is produced from any well the drilling of which began after September 30, 1978, and before January 1, 1984.




(c) Exemption for independent producers and royalty owners(1) In generalExcept as provided in subsection (d), the allowance for depletion under section 611 shall be computed in accordance with section 613 with respect to—(A) so much of the taxpayer’s average daily production of domestic crude oil as does not exceed the taxpayer’s depletable oil quantity; and

(B) so much of the taxpayer’s average daily production of domestic natural gas as does not exceed the taxpayer’s depletable natural gas quantity;


and 15 percent shall be deemed to be specified in subsection (b) of section 613 for purposes of subsection (a) of that section.

(2) Average daily productionFor purposes of paragraph (1)—(A) the taxpayer’s average daily production of domestic crude oil or natural gas for any taxable year, shall be determined by dividing his aggregate production of domestic crude oil or natural gas, as the case may be, during the taxable year by the number of days in such taxable year, and

(B) in the case of a taxpayer holding a partial interest in the production from any property (including an interest held in a partnership) such taxpayer’s production shall be considered to be that amount of such production determined by multiplying the total production of such property by the taxpayer’s percentage participation in the revenues from such property.


(3) Depletable oil quantity(A) In generalFor purposes of paragraph (1), the taxpayer’s depletable oil quantity shall be equal to—(i) the tentative quantity determined under subparagraph (B), reduced (but not below zero) by

(4) Daily depletable natural gas quantityFor purposes of paragraph (1), the depletable natural gas quantity of any taxpayer for any taxable year shall be equal to 6,000 cubic feet multiplied by the number of barrels of the taxpayer’s depletable oil quantity to which the taxpayer elects to have this paragraph apply. The taxpayer’s depletable oil quantity for any taxable year shall be reduced by the number of barrels with respect to which an election under this paragraph applies. Such election shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe.


[(5) Repealed. Pub. L. 101–508, title XI, § 11815(a)(1)(C), Nov. 5, 1990, 104 Stat. 1388–557]

(6) Oil and natural gas produced from marginal properties(A) In generalExcept as provided in subsection (d) and subparagraph (B), the allowance for depletion under section 611 shall be computed in accordance with section 613 with respect to—(i) so much of the taxpayer’s average daily marginal production of domestic crude oil as does not exceed the taxpayer’s depletable oil quantity (determined without regard to paragraph (3)(A)(ii)), and

(ii) so much of the taxpayer’s average daily marginal production of domestic natural gas as does not exceed the taxpayer’s depletable natural gas quantity (determined without regard to paragraph (3)(A)(ii)),


and the applicable percentage shall be deemed to be specified in subsection (b) of section 613 for purposes of subsection (a) of that section.

(B) Election to have paragraph apply to pro rata portion of marginal productionIf the taxpayer elects to have this subparagraph apply for any taxable year, the rules of subparagraph (A) shall apply to the average daily marginal production of domestic crude oil or domestic natural gas of the taxpayer to which paragraph (1) would have applied without regard to this paragraph.


(C) Applicable percentageFor purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “applicable percentage” means the percentage (not greater than 25 percent) equal to the sum of—(i) 15 percent, plus

(ii) 1 percentage point for each whole dollar by which $20 exceeds the reference price for crude oil for the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the taxable year begins.


For purposes of this paragraph, the term “reference price” means, with respect to any calendar year, the reference price determined for such calendar year under section 45K(d)(2)(C).

(ii) is a property substantially all of the production of which during such calendar year is heavy oil.


(E) Stripper well propertyFor purposes of this paragraph, the term “stripper well property” means, with respect to any calendar year, any property with respect to which the amount determined by dividing—(i) the average daily production of domestic crude oil and domestic natural gas from producing wells on such property for such calendar year, by

(ii) the number of such wells,


is 15 barrel equivalents or less.

(F) Heavy oilFor purposes of this paragraph, the term “heavy oil” means domestic crude oil produced from any property if such crude oil had a weighted average gravity of 20 degrees API or less (corrected to 60 degrees Fahrenheit).


(G) Average daily marginal productionFor purposes of this subsection—(i) the taxpayer’s average daily marginal production of domestic crude oil or natural gas for any taxable year shall be determined by dividing the taxpayer’s aggregate marginal production of domestic crude oil or natural gas, as the case may be, during the taxable year by the number of days in such taxable year, and

(ii) in the case of a taxpayer holding a partial interest in the production from any property (including any interest held in any partnership), such taxpayer’s production shall be considered to be that amount of such production determined by multiplying the total production of such property by the taxpayer’s percentage participation in the revenues from such property.


(H) Temporary suspension of taxable income limit with respect to marginal productionThe second sentence of subsection (a) of section 613 shall not apply to so much of the allowance for depletion as is determined under subparagraph (A) for any taxable year—(i) beginning after December 31, 1997, and before January 1, 2008, or

(ii) beginning after December 31, 2008, and before January 1, 2012.



(7) Special rules(A) Production of crude oil in excess of depletable oil quantityIf the taxpayer’s average daily production of domestic crude oil exceeds his depletable oil quantity, the allowance under paragraph (1)(A) with respect to oil produced during the taxable year from each property in the United States shall be that amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of depletion which would have been allowable under section 613(a) for all of the taxpayer’s oil produced from such property during the taxable year (computed as if section 613 applied to all of such production at the rate specified in paragraph (1) or (6), as the case may be) as his depletable oil quantity bears to the aggregate number of barrels representing the average daily production of domestic crude oil of the taxpayer for such year.


(B) Production of natural gas in excess of depletable natural gas quantityIf the taxpayer’s average daily production of domestic natural gas exceeds his depletable natural gas quantity, the allowance under paragraph (1)(B) with respect to natural gas produced during the taxable year from each property in the United States shall be that amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of depletion which would have been allowable under section 613(a) for all of the taxpayers 11 So in original. Probably should be “taxpayer’s”. natural gas produced from such property during the taxable year (computed as if section 613 applied to all of such production at the rate specified in paragraph (1) or (6), as the case may be) as the amount of his depletable natural gas quantity in cubic feet bears to the aggregate number of cubic feet representing the average daily production of domestic natural gas of the taxpayer for such year.


(C) Taxable income from the propertyIf both oil and gas are produced from the property during the taxable year, for purposes of subparagraphs (A) and (B) the taxable income from the property, in applying the taxable income limitation in section 613(a), shall be allocated between the oil production and the gas production in proportion to the gross income during the taxable year from each.


(D) PartnershipsIn the case of a partnership, the depletion allowance shall be computed separately by the partners and not by the partnership. The partnership shall allocate to each partner his proportionate share of the adjusted basis of each partnership oil or gas property. The allocation is to be made as of the later of the date of acquisition of the oil or gas property by the partnership, or January 1, 1975. A partner’s proportionate share of the adjusted basis of partnership property shall be determined in accordance with his interest in partnership capital or income and, in the case of property contributed to the partnership by a partner, section 704(c) (relating to contributed property) shall apply in determining such share. Each partner shall separately keep records of his share of the adjusted basis in each oil and gas property of the partnership, adjust such share of the adjusted basis for any depletion taken on such property, and use such adjusted basis each year in the computation of his cost depletion or in the computation of his gain or loss on the disposition of such property by the partnership. For purposes of section 732 (relating to basis of distributed property other than money), the partnership’s adjusted basis in mineral property shall be an amount equal to the sum of the partners’ adjusted basis in such property as determined under this paragraph.



(8) Business under common control; members of the same family(A) Component members of controlled group treated as one taxpayerFor purposes of this subsection, persons who are members of the same controlled group of corporations shall be treated as one taxpayer.


(B) Aggregation of business entities under common controlIf 50 percent or more of the beneficial interest in two or more corporations, trusts, or estates is owned by the same or related persons (taking into account only persons who own at least 5 percent of such beneficial interest), the tentative quantity determined under paragraph (3)(B) shall be allocated among all such entities in proportion to the respective production of domestic crude oil during the period in question by such entities.


(C) Allocation among members of the same familyIn the case of individuals who are members of the same family, the tentative quantity determined under paragraph (3)(B) shall be allocated among such individuals in proportion to the respective production of domestic crude oil during the period in question by such individuals.


(D) Definition and special rulesFor purposes of this paragraph—(i) the term “controlled group of corporations” has the meaning given to such term by section 1563(a), except that section 1563(b)(2) shall not apply and except that “more than 50 percent” shall be substituted for “at least 80 percent” each place it appears in section 1563(a),

(ii) a person is a related person to another person if such persons are members of the same controlled group of corporations or if the relationship between such persons would result in a disallowance of losses under section 267 or 707(b), except that for this purpose the family of an individual includes only his spouse and minor children.

(iii) the family of an individual includes only his spouse and minor children, and

(iv) each 6,000 cubic feet of domestic natural gas shall be treated as 1 barrel of domestic crude oil.



(9) Special rule for fiscal year taxpayersIn applying this subsection to a taxable year which is not a calendar year, each portion of such taxable year which occurs during a single calendar year shall be treated as if it were a short taxable year.


(10) Certain production not taken into accountIn applying this subsection, there shall not be taken into account the production of natural gas with respect to which subsection (b) applies.


(11) Subchapter S corporations(A) Computation of depletion allowance at shareholder levelIn the case of an S corporation, the allowance for depletion with respect to any oil or gas property shall be computed separately by each shareholder.


(B) Allocation of basisThe S corporation shall allocate to each shareholder his pro rata share of the adjusted basis of the S corporation in each oil or gas property held by the S corporation. The allocation shall be made as of the later of the date of acquisition of the property by the S corporation, or the first day of the first taxable year of the S corporation to which the Subchapter S Revision Act of 1982 applies. Each shareholder shall separately keep records of his share of the adjusted basis in each oil and gas property of the S corporation, adjust such share of the adjusted basis for any depletion taken on such property, and use such adjusted basis each year in the computation of his cost depletion or in the computation of his gain or loss on the disposition of such property by the S corporation. In the case of any distribution of oil or gas property to its shareholders by the S corporation, the corporation’s adjusted basis in the property shall be an amount equal to the sum of the shareholders’ adjusted bases in such property, as determined under this subparagraph.




(d) Limitations on application of subsection (c)(1) Limitation based on taxable incomeThe deduction for the taxable year attributable to the application of subsection (c) shall not exceed 65 percent of the taxpayer’s taxable income for the year computed without regard to—(A) any depletion on production from an oil or gas property which is subject to the provisions of subsection (c),

(B) any deduction allowable under section 199,

(C) any net operating loss carryback to the taxable year under section 172,

(D) any capital loss carryback to the taxable year under section 1212, and

(E) in the case of a trust, any distributions to its beneficiary, except in the case of any trust where any beneficiary of such trust is a member of the family (as defined in section 267(c)(4)) of a settlor who created inter vivos and testamentary trusts for members of the family and such settlor died within the last six days of the fifth month in 1970, and the law in the jurisdiction in which such trust was created requires all or a portion of the gross or net proceeds of any royalty or other interest in oil, gas, or other mineral representing any percentage depletion allowance to be allocated to the principal of the trust.


If an amount is disallowed as a deduction for the taxable year by reason of application of the preceding sentence, the disallowed amount shall be treated as an amount allowable as a deduction under subsection (c) for the following taxable year, subject to the application of the preceding sentence to such taxable year. For purposes of basis adjustments and determining whether cost depletion exceeds percentage depletion with respect to the production from a property, any amount disallowed as a deduction on the application of this paragraph shall be allocated to the respective properties from which the oil or gas was produced in proportion to the percentage depletion otherwise allowable to such properties under subsection (c).

(2) Retailers excludedSubsection (c) shall not apply in the case of any taxpayer who directly, or through a related person, sells oil or natural gas (excluding bulk sales of such items to commercial or industrial users), or any product derived from oil or natural gas (excluding bulk sales of aviation fuels to the Department of Defense)—(A) through any retail outlet operated by the taxpayer or a related person, or

(B) to any person—(i) obligated under an agreement or contract with the taxpayer or a related person to use a trademark, trade name, or service mark or name owned by such taxpayer or a related person, in marketing or distributing oil or natural gas or any product derived from oil or natural gas, or

(ii) given authority, pursuant to an agreement or contract with the taxpayer or a related person, to occupy any retail outlet owned, leased, or in any way controlled by the taxpayer or a related person.



Notwithstanding the preceding sentence this paragraph shall not apply in any case where the combined gross receipts from the sale of such oil, natural gas, or any product derived therefrom, for the taxable year of all retail outlets taken into account for purposes of this paragraph do not exceed $5,000,000. For purposes of this paragraph, sales of oil, natural gas, or any product derived from oil or natural gas shall not include sales made of such items outside the United States, if no domestic production of the taxpayer or a related person is exported during the taxable year or the immediately preceding taxable year.

(3) Related personFor purposes of this subsection, a person is a related person with respect to the taxpayer if a significant ownership interest in either the taxpayer or such person is held by the other, or if a third person has a significant ownership interest in both the taxpayer and such person. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “significant ownership interest” means—(A) with respect to any corporation, 5 percent or more in value of the outstanding stock of such corporation,

(B) with respect to a partnership, 5 percent or more interest in the profits or capital of such partnership, and

(C) with respect to an estate or trust, 5 percent or more of the beneficial interests in such estate or trust.


For purposes of determining a significant ownership interest, an interest owned by or for a corporation, partnership, trust, or estate shall be considered as owned directly both by itself and proportionately by its shareholders, partners, or beneficiaries, as the case may be.

(4) Certain refiners excludedIf the taxpayer or one or more related persons engages in the refining of crude oil, subsection (c) shall not apply to the taxpayer for a taxable year if the average daily refinery runs of the taxpayer and such persons for the taxable year exceed 75,000 barrels. For purposes of this paragraph, the average daily refinery runs for any taxable year shall be determined by dividing the aggregate refinery runs for the taxable year by the number of days in the taxable year.


(5) Percentage depletion not allowed for lease bonuses, etc.In the case of any oil or gas property to which subsection (c) applies, for purposes of section 613, the term “gross income from the property” shall not include any lease bonus, advance royalty, or other amount payable without regard to production from property.



(e) DefinitionsFor purposes of this section—(1) Crude oilThe term “crude oil” includes a natural gas liquid recovered from a gas well in lease separators or field facilities.


(2) Natural gasThe term “natural gas” means any product (other than crude oil) of an oil or gas well if a deduction for depletion is allowable under section 611 with respect to such product.


(3) DomesticThe term “domestic” refers to production from an oil or gas well located in the United States or in a possession of the United States.


(4) BarrelThe term “barrel” means 42 United States gallons.
