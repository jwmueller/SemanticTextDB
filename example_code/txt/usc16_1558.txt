§ 450jj–4. Transfer of land
Where appropriate in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, he may transfer by lease or otherwise, to any appropriate person or governmental entity, land owned by the United States (or any interest therein) which has been acquired by the Secretary under section 450jj–3 of this title. Any such transfer shall be consistent with the management plan for the area and with the requirements of section 460l–22 of this title and shall be subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Secretary deems necessary to carry out the purposes of sections 450jj to 450jj–9 of this title, including terms and conditions which provide for—(1) the continuation of existing uses of the land which are compatible with the Memorial,

(2) the protection of the important historical resources of the leased area, and

(3) the retention by the Secretary of such access and development rights as the Secretary deems necessary to provide for appropriate visitor use and resource management.


In transferring any lands or interest in lands under this section, the Secretary shall take into account the views of the Commission established under section 450jj–6 of this title.
(May 17, 1954, ch. 204, § 5, as added Pub. L. 98–398, title II, § 201(a), Aug. 24, 1984, 98 Stat. 1468.)


References in TextSection 450jj–6 of this title, referred to in text, was in the original “section 8”, meaning section 8 of act May 17, 1954, ch. 204, and was translated as reading “section 7” of such act, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because section 7 related to the establishment of the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial Commission.

Prior ProvisionsA prior section 5 of act May 17, 1954, contained a limitation on appropriation authorization and a prohibition on expenditure of Government funds and was classified as a note under section 450jj of this title, prior to the general amendment made by Pub. L. 85–936, Sept. 6, 1958, 72 Stat. 1794.
