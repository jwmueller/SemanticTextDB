§ 41905. Emergency mail transportation(a) Contract Authority.—In an emergency caused by a flood, fire, or other disaster, the United States Postal Service may make a contract without advertising to transport mail by aircraft to or from a locality affected by the emergency when the available facilities of persons authorized to transport mail to or from the locality are inadequate to meet the requirements of the Postal Service during the emergency. The contract may be only for periods necessary to maintain mail service because of the inadequacy of the facilities. Payment for transportation provided under the contract shall be made at prices provided in the contract.

(b) Transportation Not Air Transportation.—Transportation provided under a contract made under subsection (a) of this section is not air transportation within the meaning of this part.
