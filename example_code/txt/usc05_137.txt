Whistleblower Protection; Congressional Statement of Findings and PurposePub. L. 101–12, § 2, Apr. 10, 1989, 103 Stat. 16, provided that:
“(a) Findings.—The Congress finds that—“(1) Federal employees who make disclosures described in section 2302(b)(8) of title 5, United States Code, serve the public interest by assisting in the elimination of fraud, waste, abuse, and unnecessary Government expenditures;

“(2) protecting employees who disclose Government illegality, waste, and corruption is a major step toward a more effective civil service; and

“(3) in passing the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 [Pub. L. 95–454, see Tables for classification], Congress established the Office of Special Counsel to protect whistleblowers (those individuals who make disclosures described in such section 2302(b)(8)) from reprisal.


“(b) Purpose.—The purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 1989 Amendment note above] is to strengthen and improve protection for the rights of Federal employees, to prevent reprisals, and to help eliminate wrongdoing within the Government by—“(1) mandating that employees should not suffer adverse consequences as a result of prohibited personnel practices; and

“(2) establishing—“(A) that the primary role of the Office of Special Counsel is to protect employees, especially whistleblowers, from prohibited personnel practices;

“(B) that the Office of Special Counsel shall act in the interests of employees who seek assistance from the Office of Special Counsel; and

“(C) that while disciplining those who commit prohibited personnel practices may be used as a means by which to help accomplish that goal, the protection of individuals who are the subject of prohibited personnel practices remains the paramount consideration.”
