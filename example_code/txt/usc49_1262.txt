In this section, before clause (1), the title “Secretary of Commerce” is substituted for “Chief of the Weather Bureau” in section 4 of the International Aviation Facilities Act (ch. 473, 62 Stat. 451) because of sections 1 and 2 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1965 (eff. July 13, 1965, 79 Stat. 1318). The words “within or outside the United States” are omitted as surplus. The word “citizen” is substituted for “nationals” as being more appropriate. In clause (1), the word “jointly” is substituted for “or in conjunction” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government” are substituted for “United States Government agency” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.
