§ 291b. State allotments(a) Computation for individual States; formulas for both new construction and modernization(1) Each State shall be entitled for each fiscal year to an allotment bearing the same ratio to the sums appropriated for such year pursuant to subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3), respectively, of section 291a(a) of this title, and to an allotment bearing the same ratio to the sums appropriated for such year pursuant to section 291a(b) of this title, as the product of—(A) the population of such State, and

(B) the square of its allotment percentage,


bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all of the States.

(2) For each fiscal year, the Secretary shall, in accordance with regulations, make allotments among the States, from the sums appropriated for such year under section 291a(c) of this title, on the basis of the population, the financial need, and the extent of the need for modernization of the facilities referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 291a of this title, of the respective States.


(b) Minimum allotments(1) The allotment to any State under subsection (a) of this section for any fiscal year which is less than—(A) $50,000 for the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or Guam and $100,000 for any other State, in the case of an allotment for grants for the construction of public or other nonprofit rehabilitation facilities,

(B) $100,000 for the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or Guam and $200,000 for any other State in the case of an allotment for grants for the construction of public or other nonprofit outpatient facilities,

(C) $200,000 for the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or Guam and $300,000 for any other State in the case of an allotment for grants for the construction of public or other nonprofit facilities for long-term care or for the construction of public or other nonprofit hospitals and public health centers, or for the modernization of facilities referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of section 291a of this title, or

(D) $200,000 for the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or Guam and $300,000 for any other State in the case of an allotment for grants for the modernization of facilities referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 291a of this title,


shall be increased to that amount, the total of the increases thereby required being derived by proportionately reducing the allotment from appropriations under such subparagraph or paragraph to each of the remaining States under subsection (a) of this section, but with such adjustments as may be necessary to prevent the allotment of any of such remaining States from appropriations under such subparagraph or paragraph from being thereby reduced to less than that amount.

(2) An allotment of the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or Guam for any fiscal year may be increased as provided in paragraph (1) only to the extent it satisfies the Surgeon General, at such time prior to the beginning of such year as the Surgeon General may designate, that such increase will be used for payments under and in accordance with the provisions of this part.


(c) Allotment percentages; definitions; determinationFor the purposes of this part—(1) The “allotment percentage” for any State shall be 100 per centum less that percentage which bears the same ratio to 50 per centum as the per capita income of such State bears to the per capita income of the United States, except that (A) the allotment percentage shall in no case be more than 75 per centum or less than 33⅓ per centum, and (B) the allotment percentage for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the Virgin Islands shall be 75 per centum.

(2) The allotment percentages shall be determined by the Surgeon General between July 1 and September 30 of each even-numbered year, on the basis of the average of the per capita incomes of each of the States and of the United States for the three most recent consecutive years for which satisfactory data are available from the Department of Commerce, and the States shall be notified promptly thereof. Such determination shall be conclusive for each of the two fiscal years in the period beginning July 1 next succeeding such determination.

(3) The population of the several States shall be determined on the basis of the latest figures certified by the Department of Commerce.

(4) The term “United States” means (but only for purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2)) the fifty States and the District of Columbia.


(d) Availability of allotments in subsequent years(1) Any sum allotted to a State, other than the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and Guam for a fiscal year under this section and remaining unobligated at the end of such year shall remain available to such State, for the purpose for which made, for the next two fiscal years (and for such years only), in addition to the sums allotted to such State for such purposes for such next two fiscal years.

(2) Any sum allotted to the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or Guam for a fiscal year under this section and remaining unobligated at the end of such year shall remain available to it, for the purpose for which made, for the next two fiscal years (and for such years only), in addition to the sums allotted to it for such purpose for each of such next two fiscal years.


(e) Transfer of allotments(1) Upon the request of any State that a specified portion of any allotment of such State under subsection (a) of this section for any fiscal year be added to any other allotment or allotments of such State under such subsection for such year, the Secretary shall promptly (but after application of subsection (b) of this section) adjust the allotments of such State in accordance with such request and shall notify the State agency; except that the aggregate of the portions so transferred from an allotment for a fiscal year pursuant to this paragraph may not exceed the amount specified with respect to such allotment in clause (A), (B), (C), or (D), as the case may be, of subsection (b)(1) of this section which is applicable to such State.

(2) In addition to the transfer of portions of allotments under paragraph (1), upon the request of any State that a specified portion of any allotment of such State under subsection (a) of this section, other than an allotment for grants for the construction of public or other nonprofit rehabilitation facilities, be added to another allotment of such State under such subsection, other than an allotment for grants for the construction of public or other nonprofit hospitals and public health centers, and upon simultaneous certification to the Secretary by the State agency in such State to the effect that—(A) it has afforded a reasonable opportunity to make applications for the portion so specified and there have been no approvable applications for such portion, or

(B) in the case of a request to transfer a portion of an allotment for grants for the construction of public or other nonprofit hospitals and public health centers, use of such portion as requested by such State agency will better carry out the purposes of this subchapter,


the Secretary shall promptly (but after application of subsection (b) of this section) adjust the allotments of such State in accordance with such request and shall notify the State agency.

(3) In addition to the transfer of portions of allotments under paragraph (1) or (2), upon the request of any State that a specified portion of an allotment of such State under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section be added to an allotment of such State under paragraph (1) of such subsection for grants for the construction of public or other nonprofit hospitals and public health centers, and upon simultaneous certification by the State agency in such State to the effect that the need for new public or other nonprofit hospitals and public health centers is substantially greater than the need for modernization of facilities referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of section 291a of this title, the Secretary shall promptly (but after application of subsection (b) of this section) adjust the allotments of such State in accordance with such request and shall notify the State agency.

(4) After adjustment of allotments of any State, as provided in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection, the allotments as so adjusted shall be deemed to be the State’s allotments under this section.


(f) Request by State to transfer portion of allotmentIn accordance with regulations, any State may file with the Surgeon General a request that a specified portion of an allotment to it under this part for grants for construction of any type of facility, or for modernization of facilities, be added to the corresponding allotment of another State for the purpose of meeting a portion of the Federal share of the cost of a project for the construction of a facility of that type in such other State, or for modernization of a facility in such other State, as the case may be. If it is found by the Surgeon General (or, in the case of a rehabilitation facility, by the Surgeon General and the Secretary) that construction or modernization of the facility with respect to which the request is made would meet needs of the State making the request and that use of the specified portion of such State’s allotment, as requested by it, would assist in carrying out the purposes of this subchapter, such portion of such State’s allotment shall be added to the corresponding allotment of the other State, to be used for the purpose referred to above.
