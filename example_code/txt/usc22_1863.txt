Multilateral Agreement Governing Use of Nuclear-Powered SatellitesPub. L. 95–426, title VI, § 608, Oct. 7, 1978, 92 Stat. 988, as amended by Pub. L. 97–241, title V, § 505(a)(2), Aug. 24, 1982, 96 Stat. 299, provided that:
“(a) The Congress finds that—“(1) no international regime governs the use of nuclear-powered satellites in space;
