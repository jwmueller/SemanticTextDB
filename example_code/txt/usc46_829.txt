6010246 App.:57.R.S. § 4184.


The words “vessel documented under chapter 121 of this title” are substituted for “vessel, recorded in pursuance of title 48 of the Revised Statutes”, and the words “certificate of documentation” are substituted for “certificate of such record”, for consistency with chapter 121 of title 46. The words “in charge” are substituted for “having the command or charge” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “customs officer” are substituted for “collector of the district” because the office of collector of customs was abolished by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1965. For additional requirements relating to entry of vessels, see 19 U.S.C. 1434.
