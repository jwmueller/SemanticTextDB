Probable Exemptions to United Nations Employee Hiring FreezePub. L. 100–204, title VII, § 701, Dec. 22, 1987, 101 Stat. 1383, as amended by Pub. L. 102–138, title I, § 163, Oct. 28, 1991, 105 Stat. 676, provided that:
“(a) Findings.—The Congress makes the following findings:“(1) In April 1986, the Secretary-General of the United Nations adopted a freeze on the hiring of personnel within the United Nations Secretariat.

“(2) The conditions of the freeze were such that, as the terms of office for the personnel expired, replacements would not be recruited or hired to fill the vacant positions, with minor exceptions.

“(3) The freeze was designed to reduce United Nations personnel by 15 percent over three years, as recommended by the Group of High-Level Intergovernmental Experts to Review the Efficiency of the Administrative and Financial Functioning of the United Nations (commonly referred to as the ‘Group of 18 Experts’).

“(4) On May 5, 1987, the Secretary-General reported to the Department of State that he was considering granting 156 exceptions to the hiring freeze.

“(5) Of these 156 probable exceptions, 104 would be Soviet and Soviet-bloc nationals currently employed in the United Nations Secretariat—of 298 Soviet and Soviet-bloc nationals currently employed in the United Nations Secretariat—who would be replaced over the next 18 months.

“(6) According to a report from the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate on ‘Soviet Presence in the United Nations Secretariat’ (Senate Print 99–52, May 1985), approximately one-fourth of the Soviets in the United Nations Secretariat are intelligence officers, many more are co-opted by the Soviet intelligence agencies, and all Soviets in the United Nations Secretariat must respond to KGB requests for assistance.

“(7) Other United States intelligence authorities estimate that as many as one-half of the Soviet and Soviet-bloc nationals in the United Nations Secretariat are officers of the KGB or the GRU.

“(8) If the Secretary-General’s probable exemptions are adopted, the Soviet Union will be allowed to replace retiring Soviet and Soviet-bloc personnel with new, highly skilled and well-trained intelligence officers of the KGB or the GRU.

“(9) The Secretary-General’s proposed exceptions would thus provide the Soviet Union with the capability to rebuild its intelligence apparatus within the United States, which was devastated in recent years when the United States ordered severe reductions in the size of the Soviet mission to the United Nations, the Soviet Embassy in Washington, District of Columbia, and the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco, California.

“(10) Article 100 of the United Nations Charter calls for the establishment of an international civil service whose members are neutral and loyal only to the United Nations.

“(11) Section 3 of Article 101 of the United Nations Charter calls for the appointment of individuals who are professionally qualified for the positions they are to fill and maintains that due regard shall be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible.

“(12) As of September 1985, 442 of 446 Soviet nationals employed throughout the United Nations system are ‘seconded’, that is, serve on short, fixed-term contracts.

“(13) Through the abuse of short, fixed-term contracts, the Soviet Union has maintained undue influence and control over major offices of the United Nations Secretariat, thereby effectively using the United Nations Secretariat in the conduct of its foreign relations, in clear violation of Articles 100 and 101 of the United Nations Charter.

“(14) The Secretary-General’s proposed exceptions to the hiring freeze (as described in paragraphs (1) through (5)) would continue the gross violations of Articles 100 and 101 of the United Nations Charter described in paragraph (13).

“(15) The Secretary-General’s proposed exceptions to such hiring freeze would be clearly inconsistent with the terms of the United Nation’s self-imposed reform program.

“(16) The United Nations has not yet achieved its reform goals and there is no indication that the United Nations can afford to make such large exceptions to such hiring freeze.


“(b) Sense of the Congress.—It is the sense of the Congress that—“(1) the President should take all such actions necessary to ensure compliance with the hiring freeze rule, including withholding all assessed United States contributions to the United Nations, and denying United States entry visas to Soviet and Soviet-bloc applicants coming to the United States to replace Soviet and Soviet-bloc nationals currently serving in the United Nations Secretariat;

“(2) the President, through the Department of State and the United States mission to the United Nations, should express to the Secretary-General of the United Nations the insistence of the American people that the hiring freeze continue indefinitely, or until the United Nations has complied with the Group of 18 recommendations and can thus afford to make exceptions to the freeze;

“(3) the Secretary-General should revoke all exceptions to the hiring freeze rule, excepting those member-nations which have 15 or fewer nationals serving in the United Nations Secretariat, or those positions not subject to geographical representation, such as those of the general service category;

“(4) the long-term, flagrant violations of Articles 100 and 101 of the United Nations Charter and the abuse of secondment by the Soviet Union and Soviet-bloc member-nations are reprehensible;

“(5) the United Nations should adopt the recommendations of the Group of 18 (as referred to in subsection (a)(3)) that no member-nation be allowed to have more than 50 percent of its nationals employed under fixed-term contracts;

“(6) the Soviet Union is hereby condemned for—“(A) its refusal to adhere to the principles of the United Nations Charter calling for an international civil service,

“(B) its abuse of secondment, and

“(C) its absolute disregard of the solemn purpose of the United Nations to be an international civil service; and


“(7) if the Soviet Union and the Soviet-bloc intend to remain member-nations of the United Nations, they should adhere to Articles 100, 101, and all other principles of the United Nations Charter to which every other member-nation must adhere.


“(c) Definition.—For the purposes of this section, the term ‘Soviet-bloc’ means the countries of Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Nicaragua, North Korea, Poland, and Romania.”




Housing Allowances of International Civil ServantsPub. L. 100–204, title VII, § 703, Dec. 22, 1987, 101 Stat. 1389, provided that:
“(a) United States Policy.—It is the policy of the United States to seek the implementation by the United Nations of the recommendation by the International Civil Service Commission to deduct from the pay (commonly referred to as a ‘rental deduction’) of an international civil servant the amount of any housing allowance or payment which is provided by any member state to that international civil servant, in accordance with Article 100 of the Charter of the United Nations and regulations thereunder.

“(b) United States Ambassador to the United Nations.—The United States Ambassador to the United Nations shall seek to promote the adoption of the recommendation described in subsection (a).”




Reform in Budget Decision-Making Procedures of United Nations and its Specialized AgenciesPub. L. 103–236, title IV, § 409(a)–(d), Apr. 30, 1994, 108 Stat. 454, as amended by Pub. L. 107–228, div. A, title IV, § 405(b)(2), Sept. 30, 2002, 116 Stat. 1391, provided that:
“(a) Assessed Contributions.—For assessed contributions authorized to be appropriated for ‘Assessed Contributions to International Organizations’ by this Act [108 Stat. 382, 388], the President may withhold 20 percent of the funds appropriated for the United States assessed contribution to the United Nations or to any of its specialized agencies for any calendar year if the United Nations or any such agency has failed to implement or to continue to implement consensus-based decisionmaking procedures on budgetary matters which assure that sufficient attention is paid to the views of the United States and other member states that are the major financial contributors to such assessed budgets.

“(b) Notice to Congress.—The President shall notify the Congress when a decision is made to withhold any share of the United States assessed contribution to the United Nations or its specialized agencies pursuant to subsection (a) and shall notify the Congress when the decision is made to pay any previously withheld assessed contribution. A notification under this subsection shall include appropriate consultation between the President (or the President’s representative) and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.

“(c) Contributions for Prior Years.—Subject to the availability of appropriations, payment of assessed contributions for prior years may be made to the United Nations or any of its specialized agencies notwithstanding subsection (a) if such payment would further United States interests in that organization.
