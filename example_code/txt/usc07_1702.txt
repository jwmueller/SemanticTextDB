§ 2266. Congressional reaffirmation of policy to foster and encourage family farms(a) Congress reaffirms the historical policy of the United States to foster and encourage the family farm system of agriculture in this country. Congress believes that the maintenance of the family farm system of agriculture is essential to the social well-being of the Nation and the competitive production of adequate supplies of food and fiber. Congress further believes that any significant expansion of nonfamily owned large-scale corporate farming enterprises will be detrimental to the national welfare. It is neither the policy nor the intent of Congress that agricultural and agriculture-related programs be administered exclusively for family farm operations, but it is the policy and the express intent of Congress that no such program be administered in a manner that will place the family farm operation at an unfair economic disadvantage.

L. 95–113, title I, § 103, Sept. 29, 1977, 91 Stat. 919, provided that in furtherance of the policy stated in section 102 of this Act [this section], the Secretary of Agriculture was to conduct a study and report to Congress no later than January 1, 1979, on the impact on participation in the wheat, feed grain, cotton, and rice programs and the production of such commodities in carrying out a statutory provision such as that included in the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977, as passed by the Senate on May 24, 1977 [see Short Title of 1977 Amendment note set out under section 1281 of this title], prohibiting the making of payments to certain corporations and other entities under such programs, which study was to assess the impact of extending the prohibition against making commodity program payments to tenants on land owned by such corporations and other entities which would be excluded from payments under such a provision, and was to utilize the information on commodity program payments compiled by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service in determining payment eligibility under section 101 of the Agricultural Act of 1970, as amended [section 1307 of this title], and section 101 of this Act [section 1308 of this title].
