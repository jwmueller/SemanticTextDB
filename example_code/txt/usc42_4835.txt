“(a) Impact Analysis.—(1) The Secretary of Energy shall analyze the impact on the domestic economy and on consumers in the United States of reliance on market allocation and pricing during any substantial reduction in the amount of petroleum products available to the United States.

Such analysis shall—“(A) examine the equity and efficiency of such reliance,

“(B) distinguish between the impacts of such reliance on various categories of business (including small business and agriculture) and on households of different income levels,

“(C) specify the nature and administration of monetary and fiscal policies that would be followed including emergency tax cuts, emergency block grants, and emergency supplements to income maintenance programs, and

“(D) describe the likely impact on the distribution of petroleum products of State and local laws and regulations (including emergency authorities) affecting the distribution of petroleum products.


Such analysis shall include projections of the effect of the petroleum supply reduction on the price of motor gasoline, home heating oil, and diesel fuel, and on Federal tax revenues, Federal royalty receipts, and State and local tax revenues.

“(2) Within one year after the date of the enactment of this Act [Aug. 3, 1982], the Secretary of Energy shall submit a report to the Congress and the President containing the analysis required by this subsection, including a detailed step-by-step description of the procedures by which the policies specified in paragraph (1)(C) would be accomplished in an emergency, along with such recommendations as the Secretary of Energy deems appropriate.

“(2) a description of the strategy or alternative strategies of distribution which could reasonably be used to respond to each situation described under paragraph (1), together with the theory and justification underlying each such strategy.


The description of each strategy under paragraph (2) shall include an explanation of the methods which would likely be used to determine the price and distribution of petroleum products from the Reserve in any such distribution, and an explanation of the disposition of revenues arising from sales of any such petroleum products under the strategy.
