If any plan would qualify as a dependent care assistance program but for a failure to meet the requirements of this subsection, then, notwithstanding such failure, such plan shall be treated as a dependent care assistance program in the case of employees who are not highly compensated employees.


(2) DiscriminationThe contributions or benefits provided under the plan shall not discriminate in favor of employees who are highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q)) or their dependents.

(B) Salary reduction agreementsFor purposes of subparagraph (A), in the case of any benefits provided through a salary reduction agreement, a plan may disregard any employees whose compensation is less than $25,000. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “compensation” has the meaning given such term by section 414(q)(4), except that, under rules prescribed by the Secretary, an employer may elect to determine compensation on any other basis which does not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees.

(6) Utilization test not applicableA dependent care assistance program shall not be held or considered to fail to meet any requirements of subsection (d) (other than paragraphs (4) and (8) thereof) merely because of utilization rates for the different types of assistance made available under the program.

(8) Treatment of onsite facilitiesIn the case of an onsite facility maintained by an employer, except to the extent provided in regulations, the amount of dependent care assistance provided to an employee excluded with respect to any dependent shall be based on—(A) utilization of the facility by a dependent of the employee, and

(B) the value of the services provided with respect to such dependent.


(9) Identifying information required with respect to service providerNo amount paid or incurred by an employer for dependent care assistance provided to an employee shall be excluded from the gross income of such employee unless—(A) the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person performing the services are included on the return to which the exclusion relates, or
