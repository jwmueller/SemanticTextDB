In subsection (a), before clause (1), the text of 45:561(b) (1st sentence words after 3d comma) is omitted as obsolete because no regional transportation authority provided intercity rail passenger transportation after May 1, 1971. The words “On May 1, 1971” and “begin” are omitted as executed. The words “between points” and “either” are omitted as surplus. In clause (2), the words “under contract with Amtrak” are substituted for 45:561(b) (last sentence) for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “at any time subsequent to May 1, 1971” are omitted as executed.
In subsection (b), the words “concerning auto-ferry service . . . railroad or any other” are omitted as surplus.
