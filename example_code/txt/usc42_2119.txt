§ 1437f–1. Report on section 8 project-based housing
The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall report annually to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the status of all section 8 [42 U.S.C. 1437f] project-based housing, including the number of all project-based units by region as well as an analysis of all federally subsidized housing being refinanced under the Mark-to-Market program. The Secretary shall in the report identify all existing units maintained by region as section 8 project-based units and all project-based units that have opted out of section 8 or have otherwise been eliminated as section 8 project-based units. The Secretary shall identify in detail and by project all the efforts made by the Department to preserve all section 8 project-based housing units and all the reasons for any units which opted out or otherwise were lost as section 8 project-based units. Such analysis shall include a review of the impact of the loss of any subsidized units in that housing marketplace, such as the impact of cost and the loss of available subsidized, low-income housing in areas with scarce housing resources for low-income families.
