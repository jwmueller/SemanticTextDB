(f) Eligibility for Other Federal Assistance.—(1) A child or spouse of a member of the armed forces receiving the supplemental subsistence allowance under this section who, except on account of the receipt of such allowance, would be eligible to receive a benefit described in paragraph (2) shall be considered to be eligible for that benefit notwithstanding the receipt of such allowance.
