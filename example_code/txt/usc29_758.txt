“(2) The Administrator shall, after consultation with the Secretary, provide a program of job-readiness skills development and counseling services designed to assist veterans in need of such assistance in finding, applying for, and successfully participating in a suitable program of job training under this Act. As part of providing such services, the Administrator shall coordinate activities, to the extent practicable, with the readjustment counseling program described in section 1712A of title 38, United States Code. The Administrator shall advise veterans participating under this Act of the availability of such services and encourage them to request such services whenever appropriate.


“(b)(1) The Secretary shall provide for a program under which—“(A) except as provided in paragraph (2), a disabled veteran’s outreach program specialist appointed under section 4103A(a) of title 38, United States Code, is assigned as a case manager for each veteran participating in a program of job training under this Act;

“(B) the veteran has an in-person interview with the case manager not later than 60 days after entering into a program of training under this Act; and

“(C) periodic (not less frequent than monthly) contact is maintained with each such veteran for the purpose of (i) avoiding unnecessary termination of employment, (ii) referring the veteran to appropriate counseling, if necessary, (iii) facilitating the veteran’s successful completion of such program, and (iv) following up with the employer and the veteran in order to determine the veteran’s progress in the program and the outcome regarding the veteran’s participation in and successful completion of the program.


“(2) No case manager shall be assigned pursuant to paragraph (1)(A)—“(A) for a veteran if, on the basis of a recommendation made by a disabled veterans’ outreach program specialist, the Secretary determines that there is no need for a case manager for such veteran; or

“(B) in the case of the employees of an employer, if the Secretary determines that—“(i) the employer has an appropriate and effective employee assistance program that is available to all veterans participating in the employer’s programs of job training under this Act; or

“(ii) the rate of veterans’ successful completion of the employer’s programs of job training under this Act, either cumulatively or during the previous program year, is 60 percent or higher.



“(3) The Secretary and the Administrator shall jointly provide, to the extent feasible—“(A) a program of counseling or other services (to be provided pursuant to subchapter IV of chapter 3 [see chapter 63] of title 38, United States Code, and sections 1712A, 4103A, and 4104 of such title) designed to resolve difficulties that may be encountered by veterans during their training under this Act; and

“(B) a program of information services under which—“(i) each veteran who enters into a program of job training under this Act and each employer participating under this Act is informed of the supportive services and resources available to the veteran (I) under clauses (A) and (B), (II) through Veterans’ Administration counseling and career-development activities (especially, in the case of a Vietnam-era veteran, readjustment counseling services under section 1712A of such title) and under title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 [29 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.], and (III) through other appropriate agencies in the community; and

“(ii) veterans and employers are encouraged to request such services whenever appropriate.




“(c) Before a veteran who voluntarily terminates from a program of job training under this Act or is involuntarily terminated from such program by the employer may be eligible to be provided with a further certificate, or renewal of certification, of eligibility for participation under this Act, such veteran must be provided by the Secretary, after consultation with the Administrator, with a case manager.

“(d) Payments made under this Act pursuant to contracts entered into for the provision of job-readiness skills development and counseling services under subsection (a)(2) may only be paid out of the same account used to make payments under section 3104(a)(7) of title 38, United States Code, and the amount paid out of such account in any fiscal year for such services shall not exceed an amount equal to 5 percent of the amount obligated to carry out this Act for such fiscal year, except that for fiscal year 1988 the amount shall not exceed 5 percent of the amount available to carry out this Act on October 1, 1987.
