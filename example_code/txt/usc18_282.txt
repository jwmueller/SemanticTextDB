Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 76c and 76d (June 5, 1939, ch. 184, §§ 1, 2, 53 Stat. 809).
The first provision of section 76c of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to fraudulently pretending to be a member of a 4–H Club was incorporated in section 916 of this title.
The language describing the emblem was transposed.
Unnecessary words were omitted from punishment provision, and “$250” was substituted for “$300” to make the punishment consonant with the penalties provided for similar offenses. (See sections 701, 704, 705 of this title for similar offenses.)
The language of section 76d of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was rephrased and inserted after “whoever,” in the second paragraph.
Minor changes were made in phraseology.
