“Sec. 631. (a) A member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps who—“(1) was on active duty (other than for training) on Sept. 14, 1981; and

“(2) after such date is involuntarily discharged or released from active duty under any provision of title 10, United States Code, as in effect after such date,


is entitled to receive any readjustment payment or severance pay to which he would have been entitled under laws in effect on Sept. 14, 1981, unless (in the case of a member discharged or released on or after the date of the enactment of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1985 [Oct. 19, 1984]) the Secretary concerned determines that the conditions under which the member is discharged or separated do not warrant such pay.

“(b) If a member who is entitled to receive a readjustment payment or severance pay under subsection (a) is also eligible to receive separation pay under section 1174 of title 10, United States Code, as added by this Act, the member may not receive both the readjustment payment and severance pay under laws in effect on Sept. 14, 1981, and separation pay under such section, but shall elect which he will receive. If the number fails to make an election in a timely manner, he shall be paid the amount which is more favorable to him.
