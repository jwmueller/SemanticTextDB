The Judicial Conference shall review rules prescribed under section 2071 of this title by the courts, other than the Supreme Court and the district courts, for consistency with Federal law. The Judicial Conference may modify or abrogate any such rule so reviewed found inconsistent in the course of such a review.

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 218 (Sept. 14, 1922, ch. 306, § 2, 42 Stat. 838; July 5, 1937, ch. 427, 50 Stat. 473).
Provisions as to associate justice acting when Chief Justice is disabled are omitted as unnecessary in view of section 3 of this title giving senior associate justice power to act upon the disability of the Chief Justice.
The provision of section 218 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as to traveling expenses is incorporated in section 456 of this title.
Provision as to time and place for holding conference was omitted as unnecessary since the Chief Justice is vested with discretionary power to designate the time and place under the language retained.
The references to “chief judge” are in harmony with other sections of this title. (See Reviser’s Note under section 136 of this title.)
Provision for stated annual reports by the chief judge of the district was omitted as obsolete and unnecessary in view of sections 332 and 333 of this title.
The last paragraph is new and is inserted to authorize the communication to Congress of information which now reaches that body only because incorporated in the annual report of the Attorney General.
Numerous changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.
