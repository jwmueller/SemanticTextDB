“Sec. 5. [Payments; exchange rate; medium; extraterritorial claimants; purchasers of claims; Educational Programs Fund; reversion of funds to United States Treasury]. (a) Each award made under this Act shall be certified to the Secretary of the Treasury in terms of United States currency on the basis of the rate of exchange (that is, P/2 equals $1) which was applied in the Philippine Rehabilitation Act of 1946 [sections 1751 to 1806 of this Appendix], for payment out of sums appropriated pursuant to section 8 of this Act. Such payments shall be made in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe. Payments authorized under this Act shall be made in United States dollars or in Philippine pesos at the option of the Secretary of the Treasury; however, notwithstanding the last sentence of the first section of this Act, payment shall not be made outside of the Republic of the Philippines to any claimant residing outside the Republic of the Philippines unless he establishes to the satisfaction of the Commission that since the date of the loss or damage on account of which the original award was made he has heretofore invested in such manner as furthered the rehabilitation or economic development of the Philippines an amount not less than the claims approved in his favor after reduction under the last proviso of section 102(a) of the Philippine Rehabilitation Act of 1946 [section 1752(a) of this Appendix]. Any balance of the appropriation made pursuant to section 8 remaining after the payments authorized by the first section of this Act have been made and after any administrative expenses incurred by the Commission in connection with such payments have been paid shall be paid into a special fund in the United States Treasury to be used for the purpose of furthering educational exchange and other educational programs to the mutual advantage of the Republic of the Philippines and the United States in such manner as the Presidents of those two Republics shall from time to time determine. There shall be withheld from the payment authorized by the preceding sentence a sum equal to the difference between $73,000,000 (less administrative expenses) and the total amount which would have been paid to the claimants under the provisions of Public Law 87–616, which sum shall revert to the general funds in the United States Treasury. The acceptance by any claimant of a payment under this Act shall be considered to be in full satisfaction and final settlement of all claims of such claimant arising out of awards for war damage compensation made by the Philippine War Damage Commission. Payment shall not be made under this Act on any claim filed under the Philippine Rehabilitation Act of 1946 [sections 1751 to 1806 of this Appendix] or under this Act which was acquired from a predecessor in interest by purchase, except where such purchase was in the ordinary course of business in connection with the acquisition of all assets of a business firm.“(b) Such of the records of the Philippine War Damage Commission as the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission may deem necessary for carrying out its functions under this Act shall be transferred to the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission.
