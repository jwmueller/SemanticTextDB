§ 474. Continuation of allowances
The Secretary of the Interior is directed to continue the allowance of the articles enumerated in section 17 of the Act of March 2, 1889 (23 Stat. L. 894), or their commuted cash value under the Act of June 10, 1896 (29 Stat. L. 334), to all Sioux Indians who would be eligible, but for the provisions of this Act, to receive allotments of lands in severalty under section 19 of the Act of May 29, 1908 (25 Stat. L. 451), or under any prior Act, and who have the prescribed status of the head of a family or single person over the age of eighteen years, and his approval shall be final and conclusive, claims therefor to be paid as formerly from the permanent appropriation made by said section 17 and carried on the books of the Treasury for this purpose. No person shall receive in his own right more than one allowance of the benefits, and application must be made and approved during the lifetime of the allottee or the right shall lapse. Such benefits shall continue to be paid upon such reservation until such time as the lands available therein for allotment on June 18, 1934, would have been exhausted by the award to each person receiving such benefits of an allotment of eighty acres of such land.
(June 18, 1934, ch. 576, § 14, 48 Stat. 987.)

Act of June 10, 1896, referred to in text, is act June 10, 1896, ch. 398, 29 Stat. 334, which contains a provision directing the Secretary of the Interior to ascertain the number of Sioux and Ponca Indians in South Dakota and Nebraska who would not be benefited by the fulfillment of the proviso quoted above from the act of March 2, 1889, and who desire to have the articles of personal property, therein mentioned converted into money, and in lieu of such articles of personal property, or any part thereof he may think proper, to convert or commute the same, or so much thereof as he may think proper, into money, and to pay the amount thereof to such Indians.
This Act, referred to in text, is act June 18, 1934, which is classified generally to this subchapter. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 461 of this title and Tables.
Section 19 of the Act of May 29, 1908, referred to in text, probably means section 19 of act May 29, 1908, ch. 216, 35 Stat. 451, which authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to cause allotments to be made under the provisions of act Mar. 2, 1889, ch. 405, 25 Stat. 888, to any living children of the Sioux tribe of Indians belonging on any of the Great Sioux reservations affected thereby and who had not prior to May 29, 1908, been allotted, so long as the tribe to which such Indian children belong is possessed of any unallotted tribal or reservation lands. The section further provides that where, for any reason, an Indian did not receive the quantity of land to which he was entitled under the provisions of said act March 2, 1889, the Secretary of the Interior shall cause to be allotted to him sufficient additional lands on the reservation to which he belongs to make, together with the quantity of land theretofore allotted to him, the acreage to which he is entitled under said act March 2, 1889; and in case of the death of any such Indian, the additional lands to which he is of right entitled may be allotted to his heirs: Provided, the tribe to which he belonged is possessed of any unallotted tribal or reservation lands.

AppropriationsSection 2 of act June 26, 1934, ch. 756, 48 Stat. 1225, which was classified to section 725a of former Title 31, Money and Finance, repealed the permanent appropriation under the title “Civilization of the Sioux (4x950)” effective July 1, 1935, and provided that such portions of any Acts as make permanent appropriations to be expended under such account are amended so as to authorize, in lieu thereof, annual appropriations from the general fund of the Treasury in identical terms and in such amounts as now provided by the laws providing such permanent appropriations.
