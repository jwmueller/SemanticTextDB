§ 387. Duties of officers of customs and marshals as to seizure
The collectors of the several ports of entry, the surveyors of the several ports of delivery, and the marshals of the several judicial districts within the United States, shall seize any vessel or boat built, purchased, fitted out, or held as mentioned in section 385 of this title, which may be found within their respective ports or districts, and to cause the same to be proceeded against and disposed of as provided by that section.
(R.S. § 4299.)


References in TextSurveyors of the several ports of delivery, referred to in text, are probably obsolete offices in view of act July 5, 1932, ch. 430, title I, § 1, 47 Stat. 584, which abolished the offices of surveyors of customs, except at the Port of New York. Ports of delivery, except those which were made ports of entry, were abolished and the use of the term “port of delivery” was discontinued under the President’s plan of reorganization of the customs service communicated to Congress by message dated Mar. 3, 1913.
