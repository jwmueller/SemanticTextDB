See Southern Ry. Co. v. United States, 222 U.S. 20, 26 (1911). In clauses (1)–(3), the word “vehicle” is substituted for “any car” in 45:2, “car” in 45:4, “all trains, locomotives, tenders, cars, and similar vehicles used on . . . all other locomotives, tenders, cars, and similar vehicles used in connection therewith” in 45:8, and “any car subject to the provisions of said sections . . . to wit: All cars” in 45:11, and “any car or vehicle” in 45:12 for clarity, for consistency in the revised title, to eliminate unnecessary words, and because of the definition of “vehicle” in section 20301 of the revised title. In clause (1)(A), a comma is placed after the word “uncoupled” for clarity. See Johnson v. Southern Pacific Co., 196 U.S. 1, 18 (1904). In clause (1)(C), the words “by the Secretary of Transportation” are added for clarity because of 45:12.

In clause (5)(B), the words “the engineer is using the power or train brakes on those vehicles and on all other vehicles equipped with them that are associated with those vehicles in the train” are substituted for “their brakes used and operated by the engineer of the locomotive drawing such train; and all power-braked cars in such train which are associated together with said 50 per centum shall have their brakes so used and operated” and “all . . . locomotives, tenders, cars, and similar vehicles” for clarity and consistency in this section. The text of section 2 (2d sentence) of the Act of March 2, 1903 (ch. 976, 32 Stat. 943), as added by section (1)(b) of the Power or Train Brakes Safety Appliance Act of 1958 (Public Law 85–375, 72 Stat. 86), is omitted as executed.

The words “a vehicle that is not equipped with power or train brakes that will work and readily interchange with the power or train brakes in use on the vehicles of the complying railroad carrier” are substituted for “any cars not equipped sufficiently, in accordance with said section, with such power or train brakes as will work and readily interchange with the brakes in use on its own cars, as required by sections 1 to 7 of this title” in 45:3 for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsection (c), the words “Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section” are added for clarity.

The text of section 3 (proviso) of the Act of April 14, 1910 (ch. 160, 36 Stat. 298), is omitted as obsolete.
In subsection (d)(2), the text of 45:9 (2d sentence words before proviso) is omitted as executed.
In subsection (d)(3), the words “to more fully carry into effect the objects of said sections” and “from time to time” are omitted as surplus.
