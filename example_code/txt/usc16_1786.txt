References in TextThis part, referred to in text, was in the original “this Act”, meaning Pub. L. 88–578, Sept. 3, 1964, 78 Stat. 897, which is classified principally to this part. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 460l–4 of this title and Tables.

Codification
In addition to the text set out in the section above, the original contained provisions directing the repeal of section 14 of this title and the deletion of “, without charge,” in the sentence of section 460d of this title beginning “The water areas of all such projects shall be open to public use generally”. The repeals and deletions called for by those provisions were executed as thus directed so that those provisions have been omitted from the text as executed.
Section formerly constituted the fourth paragraph of section 2(a) of Pub. L. 88–578 which was classified to section 460l–5(a) of this title. The paragraph was lifted out of section 2(a) and redesignated section 10 by section 1(a) of Pub. L. 90–401, which, for purposes of classification, resulted in the designation of the paragraph as section 460l–10c of this title [this section].

Effective DateSection effective Jan. 1, 1965, see note set out under section 460l–4 of this title. Transfer of the provisions of this section from section 460l–5(a) of this title to this section effective Dec. 31, 1971, see section 1(d) of Pub. L. 90–401, as amended by section 1 of Pub.
