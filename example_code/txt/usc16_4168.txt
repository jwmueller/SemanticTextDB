There are authorized to be appropriated $6,700,000 per year to carry out the provisions of this Act [probably should be “this title”, see Tables for classification] through fiscal year 2004.

“(b) Existing Authority.—Except for the measures required by this subtitle [this note], nothing in this subtitle shall be construed to limit the authority of the North Pacific Council or the Secretary under the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

“(c) Changes to Fishery Cooperative Limitations and Pollock CDQ Allocation.—The North Pacific Council may recommend and the Secretary may approve conservation and management measures in accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Act—“(1) that supersede the provisions of this subtitle, except for sections 206 and 208, for conservation purposes or to mitigate adverse effects in fisheries or on owners of fewer than three vessels in the directed pollock fishery caused by this title or fishery cooperatives in the directed pollock fishery, provided such measures take into account all factors affecting the fisheries and are imposed fairly and equitably to the extent practicable among and within the sectors in the directed pollock fishery;

“(2) that supersede the allocation in section 206(a) for any of the years 2002, 2003, and 2004, upon the finding by such Council that the western Alaska community development quota program for pollock has been adversely affected by the amendments in this subtitle; or

“(3) that supersede the criteria required in paragraph (1) of section 210(b) to be used by the Secretary to set the percentage allowed to be harvested by catcher vessels pursuant to a fishery cooperative under such paragraph.

“(e) Report on Fillet Production.—Not later than June 1, 2000, the General Accounting Office [now Government Accountability Office] shall submit a report to the North Pacific Council, the Secretary, and the Congress on whether this Act has negatively affected the market for fillets and fillet blocks, including through the reduction in the supply of such fillets and fillet blocks. If the report determines that such market has been negatively affected, the North Pacific Council shall recommend measures for the Secretary’s approval to mitigate any negative effects.

“(f) Severability.—If any provision of this title, an amendment made by this title, or the application of such provision or amendment to any person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this title, the amendments made by this title, and the application of the provisions of such to any person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.

“(g) International Agreements.—In the event that any provision of section 12102(c) [now 12113(b)(2) to (d)] or section 31322(a) of title 46, United States Code, as amended by this Act, is determined to be inconsistent with an existing international agreement relating to foreign investment to which the United States is a party with respect to the owner or mortgagee on [sic] of a vessel with a fishery endorsement, such provision shall not apply to that owner or mortgagee with respect to their ownership or mortgage interest in such vessel on that date to the extent of any such inconsistency.
