“In the case of any deceased individual—“(1) who is a World War II veteran (as defined in section 217(d)(2) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 417(d)(2)]) or a veteran (as defined in section 217(e)(4) of such Act); and

“(2) whose widow or child is entitled under the Civil Service Retirement Act of May 29, 1930, as amended [see section 8301 et seq. of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees], to an annuity in the computation of which his active military or naval service after September 15, 1940, and before January 1, 1957, was included; and

“(3) whose widow or child is entitled under section 202 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 402], on the basis of his wages and self-employment income, to a monthly benefit in the computation of which such active military or naval service was excluded (under clause (B) of subsection (a)(1) or (e)(1) of section 217 of such Act) solely by reason of the annuity described in the preceding paragraph; and

“(4) whose widow or child is entitled by reason of section 217(f) of the Social Security Act to have such active military or naval service included in the computation of such monthly benefit,


the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare [now Health and Human Services] shall, notwithstanding the provisions of section 215(f)(1) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 415(f)(1)], recompute the primary insurance amount of such individual upon the filing of an application, after December 1956, by or on behalf of such widow or child. Such recomputation shall be made only in the manner provided in title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] as in effect at the time of such individual’s death, and as though application therefor was filed in the month in which he died. No recomputation made under this subsection shall be regarded as a recomputation under section 215(f) of the Social Security Act. Any such recomputation shall be effective for and after the twelfth month before the month in which the application is filed, but in no case for any month before the first month with respect to which such widow or child is entitled by reason of section 217(f) of the Social Security Act to have such active military or naval service included in the computation of such monthly benefits. The terms used in this subsection shall have the same meaning as when used in title II of the Social Security Act.”
