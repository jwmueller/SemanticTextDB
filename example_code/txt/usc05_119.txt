(2)5 U.S.C. 133z–6.June 20, 1949, ch. 226, § 8, 63 Stat. 206.


In paragraph (1)(A), the words “an Executive agency or part thereof” are coextensive with and substituted for “any executive department, commission, council, independent establishment, Government corporation, board, bureau, division, service, . . . authority, administration, or other establishment, in the executive branch of the Government” and to conform to the definition in section 105.
In paragraph (1)(B), the words “an office or officer in the civil service or uniformed services in or under an Executive agency” are substituted for “office, officer, . . . in the executive branch of the Government” to conform to the definitions in sections 105, 2101, and 2104.
Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.

1967 ActThis section amends section 902 of title 5, United States Code, so as to preserve the application of the source statute for section 902 (sec. 7 of the Reorganization Act of 1949). In the codification of title 5 by Public Law 89–554, that application was inadvertently restricted due to the operation of section 2104 of title 5, providing a title-wide definition of “officer.” Briefly, that section defines “officer” as a civil appointive officer of the Federal Government. In the Reorganization Act of 1949, the word “officer” was not defined, and has been construed to include not only civil appointive officers, but uniformed officers, the President, and officers of the government of the District of Columbia. Thus, this section amends section 902 of title 5 by inserting a paragraph providing that the title-wide definition of officer is inapplicable to chapter 9 of title 5. Also, paragraph (1)(B) of section 902 is amended so that the wording thereof is identical to that formerly appearing in section 7 of the Reorganization Act of 1949.

Codification
Section 902(a) of former Title 5, Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees, was transferred to section 60e–2(b) of Title 2, The Congress.

Amendments2004—Par. (1). Pub. L. 108–271 substituted “Government Accountability Office” for “General Accounting Office” in concluding provisions.
1977—Par. (1)(C). Pub. L. 95–17 struck out subpar. (C) which defined “agency” as any and all parts of the government of the District of Columbia other than the courts thereof.

Effective Date of 1967 AmendmentAmendment by Pub. L. 90–83 effective Sept. 6, 1966, for all purposes, see section 9(h) of Pub. L. 90–83, set out as a note under section 5102 of this title.
