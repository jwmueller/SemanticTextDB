In subsection (a), the word “agency” is substituted for “department of the Government” because of section 101 of the revised title and for consistency with the other source provisions restated in the section.
In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words “buy or lease” are substituted for “purchase or hire” for consistency. In clause (1)(C), the words “section 101 of title 5” are used because of section 7(b) of the Act of September 6, 1966 (Pub. L. 89–554, 80 Stat. 631).
In subsection (c)(1), before clause (A), the word “agency” is substituted for “department” for consistency. The words “total cost” are substituted for “cost” because of the restatement. The words “(except costs required only for transportation)” are substituted for “which shall be in addition to the amount required for transportation” for clarity. Clause (A) is substituted for “completely equipped for operation” and 31:638a(c)(1)(2d sentence) to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsection (c)(2), the words “Notwithstanding any other provisions of law” are omitted as surplus.
In subsection (d), the words “armed forces” are substituted for “Military and Naval Establishments” for consistency.
In subsection (e)(2), the words “motor boats, trucks” in 31:638d are omitted as being included in “vehicles”. The words “adopted by Congress” are omitted as surplus.
In subsection (e)(3), the words “horse-drawn” in 31:638e are omitted because the section applies only to motor vehicles and aircraft described in 31:638a and also is obsolete. The words “motor boats” are omitted as being included in “vehicles”.
