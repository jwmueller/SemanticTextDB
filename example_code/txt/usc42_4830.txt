(4) minimization of the impact of such acquisition upon supply levels and market forces; and

(5) encouragement of competition in the petroleum industry.


(c) ProceduresThe Secretary shall develop, with public notice and opportunity for comment, procedures consistent with the objectives of this section to acquire petroleum for the Reserve. Such procedures shall take into account the need to—(1) maximize overall domestic supply of crude oil (including quantities stored in private sector inventories);

(2) avoid incurring excessive cost or appreciably affecting the price of petroleum products to consumers;

Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary may set such terms and conditions as he deems necessary for such acquisition.

(2) Crude oil purchased by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection shall be by competitive bid. The price paid by the Secretary—(A) shall take into account the cost of production including costs of reservoir and well maintenance; and

(B) shall not exceed the price that would have been paid if the Secretary had acquired petroleum products of a similar quality on the open market under competitive bid procedures without regard to the source of the petroleum products.
