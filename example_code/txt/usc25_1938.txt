(b) Conveyancing requirement; specific findings for nonexecutionThe Secretary must execute such instrument of conveyance needed to effectuate a sale or exchange of tribal lands made pursuant to an approved tribal land consolidation plan unless he makes a specific finding that such sale or exchange is not in the best interest of the tribe or is not in compliance with the tribal land consolidation plan.

1984—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 98–608 amended subsec. (a) generally, substituting “: Provided, That—” for period at end and inserting five numbered pars., thereby correcting errors originally contained in this section as enacted by Pub. L. 97–459, the text of which had a portion of section 204 appearing in section 206 (classified to section 2205 of this title) as the result of inadvertent error in the execution of committee amendments (see House Report No. 97–908, Sept. 30, 1982) to the bill.

(b) within this section and substituted a period for the dash after “tribal land consolidation plan”, thereby correcting errors originally contained in this section as enacted by Pub.

(b) as part of section 206(b) of Pub. L. 97–459 and ended it with “tribal land consolidation plan—”.
