§ 1985. Attorney’s fees; penalty for overcharging
The Attorney General, in rendering an award in favor of any claimant, may as a part of the award determine and allow reasonable attorneys’ fees, which shall not exceed 10 per centum of the amount allowed, to be paid out of, but not in addition to, the amount of such award.
Any attorney who charges, demands, receives, or collects for services rendered in connection with such claim any amount in excess of that allowed under this section, if recovery be had, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall upon conviction thereof be subject to a fine of not more than $2,000, or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.
(July 2, 1948, ch. 814, § 5, 62 Stat. 1232.)
