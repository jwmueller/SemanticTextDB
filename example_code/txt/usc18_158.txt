(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 704; Oct. 31, 1951, ch. 655, § 20(a), 65 Stat. 717; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §§ 330004(17), 330016(2)(F), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2142, 2148.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 119, first and second paragraphs, of title 41 U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Contracts (July 1, 1944, ch. 358, § 19(a), 58 Stat. 667).
Section was rewritten with changes of phraseology to conform to the style adopted in the revision.
The definition of “records” was omitted as surplusage in order to avoid any inference that “records” as used in other sections was intended to have a different or more limited connotation than the broad and commonly understood meaning popularly assigned to the term.
The last paragraph was added to obviate any possibility of doubt as to meaning of terms defined in section 103 of Title 41, Public Contracts.
Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “principal” in section 2 of this title.
