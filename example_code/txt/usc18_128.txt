The words “under subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5” are substituted for “under this Act” (Federal Employees’ Compensation Act) to reflect the codification of the Act in title 5, United States Code.
The words “is approved by the Secretary of Labor” are substituted for “is so approved”. The words “Secretary of Labor” are substituted for “Administrator” (Federal Security Administrator) on authority of 1950 Reorg. Plan No. 19, § 1, eff. May 24, 1950, 64 Stat. 1271.
The words “shall be guilty of a misdemeanor” are omitted as unnecessary in view of the definitive section 1 of this title. (See reviser’s note under 18 U.S.C. 212, 1964 ed.)
The words “and upon conviction thereof” are omitted as unnecessary because punishment can be imposed only after conviction.
The words “or both” are substituted for “or by both such fine and imprisonment”.
Minor changes in phraseology are made to conform to the style of title 18.
