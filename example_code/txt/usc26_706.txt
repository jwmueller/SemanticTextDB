then, under such terms and conditions as the Secretary by regulations shall prescribe, transfers of assets, stock, or both, will be deemed to be a reorganization within the meaning of section 368, a transaction to which section 355 applies, an exchange of stock to which section 351 applies, or a combination thereof. The preceding sentence shall apply only to the extent that the transfer or transfers involved are for the purpose of preventing the separation of the ownership of the stock in the DISC from the ownership of the trade or business which (during the base period) produced the export gross receipts of the DISC.

(f) Interest on DISC-related deferred tax liability(1) In generalA shareholder of a DISC shall pay for each taxable year interest in an amount equal to the product of—(A) the shareholder’s DISC-related deferred tax liability for such year, and

Determinations under the preceding sentence shall be made without regard to carrybacks to such taxable year.

(B) Adjustments for losses, credits, and other itemsThe Secretary shall prescribe regulations which provide such adjustments—(i) to the accounts of the DISC, and

(ii) the amount of the distributions-in-excess-of-income for the taxable year of the DISC following the computation year.


(B) Computation yearFor purposes of applying subparagraph (A) with respect to any taxable year of a shareholder, the computation year is the taxable year of the DISC which ends with (or within) the taxable year of the shareholder which precedes the taxable year of the shareholder for which the amount of deferred DISC income is being determined.


(C) Distributions-in-excess-of-incomeFor purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “distributions-in-excess-of-income” means, with respect to any taxable year of a DISC, the excess (if any) of—(i) the amount of actual distributions to the shareholder out of accumulated DISC income, over

(ii) the shareholder’s pro rata share of the DISC income for such taxable year.



(4) Base period T-bill rateFor purposes of this subsection, the term “base period T-bill rate” means the annual rate of interest determined by the Secretary to be equivalent to the average of the 1-year constant maturity Treasury yields, as published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, for the 1-year period ending on September 30 of the calendar year ending with (or of the most recent calendar year ending before) the close of the taxable year of the shareholder.


(5) Short yearsThe Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary for the application of this subsection to short years of the DISC, the shareholder, or both.


(6) Payment and assessment and collection of interestThe interest accrued during any taxable year which a shareholder is required to pay under paragraph (1) shall be treated, for purposes of this title, as interest payable under section 6601 and shall be paid by the shareholder at the time the tax imposed by this chapter for such taxable year is required to be paid.


(7) DISC includes former DISCFor purposes of this subsection, the term “DISC” includes a former DISC.



(g) Treatment of tax-exempt shareholdersIf any organization described in subsection (a)(2) or (b)(2) of section 511 (or any other person otherwise subject to tax under section 511) is a shareholder in a DISC—(1) any amount deemed distributed to such shareholder under subsection (b),

(2) any actual distribution to such shareholder which under section 996 is treated as out of accumulated DISC income, and

(3) any gain which is treated as a dividend under subsection (c),


shall be treated as derived from the conduct of an unrelated trade or business (and the modifications of section 512(b) shall not apply). The rules of the preceding sentence shall apply also for purposes of determining any such shareholder’s DISC-related deferred tax liability under subsection (f).
