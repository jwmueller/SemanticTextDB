“The Congress finds and declares that—
“(A) individual health status can be effectively and economically improved through an adequate investment in community public health programs and services;

“(B) the Federal Government and the States and their communities share in the financial responsibility for funding public health programs;

“(C) the Federal contribution to funds for public health programs should serve as an incentive to an additional investment by State and local governments;

“(D) existing categorical programs of Federal financial assistance to combat specific public health problems should be supplemented by a national program of stable generic support for such public health activities as the prevention and control of environmental health hazards, prevention and control of diseases, prevention and control of health problems of particularly vulnerable population groups, and development and regulation of health care facilities and health services delivery systems; and

“(E) the States and their communities, not the Federal Government, should have primary responsibility for identifying and measuring the impact of public health problems and the allocation of resources for their amelioration.”

“(a) The Congress declares that fulfillment of our national purpose depends on promoting and assuring the highest level of health attainable for every person, in an environment which contributes positively to healthful individual and family living; that attainment of this goal depends on an effective partnership, involving close intergovernmental collaboration, official and voluntary efforts, and participation of individuals and organizations; that Federal financial assistance must be directed to support the marshaling of all health resources—national, State, and local—to assure comprehensive health services of high quality for every person, but without interference with existing patterns of private professional practice of medicine, dentistry, and related healing arts.

“(b) To carry out such purpose, and recognizing the changing character of health problems, the Congress finds that comprehensive planning for health services, health manpower, and health facilities is essential at every level of government; that desirable administration requires strengthening the leadership and capacities of State health agencies; and that support of health services provided people in their communities should be broadened and made more flexible.”

“(2) that periodic inventories providing reasonably current information on these matters are urgently needed for purposes such as (A) appraisal of the true state of health of our population (including both adults and children), (B) adequate planning of any programs to improve their health, (C) research in the field of chronic diseases, and (D) measurement of the numbers of persons in the working ages so disabled as to be unable to perform gainful work.


“(b) It is, therefore, the purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 1956 Amendment note set out under section 201 of this title] to provide (1) for a continuing survey and special studies to secure on a non-compulsory basis accurate and current statistical information on the amount, distribution, and effects of illness and disability in the United States and the services received for or because of such conditions; and (2) for studying methods and survey techniques for securing such statistical information, with a view toward their continuing improvement.”
