Before the enactment of the National Security Act of 1947, the transport functions covered by this section were performed only by the Army. Under section 2(a)(3) of the National Security Act (as it existed before August 10, 1949), the sea and air transportation functions of the Army, Navy, and Air Force were respectively consolidated into the “Military Sea Transportation Service”, under the Department of the Navy, and the “Military Air Transport Service”, under the Department of the Air Force. Instead of having space on its own transport vessels and airplanes, the Army is now allotted bulk space on vessels and airplanes operated by those transport services. The words “or, within bulk space allocations made to the Department of the Army, on vessels or airplanes operated by any military transport agency of the Department of Defense” are inserted, in accordance with an opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1953/5885, 22 July 1953), to make clear that the rule applicable to Army vessels and airplanes applies to the bulk space allocated to the Army. Since the authority to perform transportation functions could again be transferred as between the military departments, the reference to “vessels or airplanes of Army transport agencies” is retained. The word “considers” is substituted for the words “in the opinion of”. The words “Persons residing in Alaska who are and have been employed there by the United States” are substituted for the words “employees of the United States, residing in Alaska, who have been in such employment”. The word “commercial” is substituted for the word “civil” for clarity. The words “from and after November 21, 1941”, “and the carriage of all such air traffic shall be terminated”, “dire”, “the privilege herein granted”, and “as to each eligible individual” are omitted as surplusage. The words “the continental” are omitted, since section 101(1) of this title defines the United States as “the States and the District of Columbia”.

L. 108–375, § 1072(a), (b)(3)(A), renumbered section 4746 of this title as this section and, in introductory provisions, struck out “Army transport agencies or, within bulk space allocations made to the Department of the Army, on vessels or airplanes operated by any military transport agency of” before “the Department of Defense”.

“(B) the transportation cannot”.
1984—Par. (4)(A). Pub. L. 98–443 substituted “Secretary of Transportation” for “Civil Aeronautics Board”.
