§ 225. Fund for education of Iranian students in United States
There is authorized to be appropriated, out of any funds in the Treasury of the United States not otherwise appropriated, the sum of $110,000, which sum shall be expended by the Secretary of State in his discretion for the education of Iranian students in the United States, in accordance with the obligation of the United States arising out of the agreement contained in an exchange of notes between this Government and the Iranian Government of July 25, July 29, November 9, and November 15, 1924, which agreement settled a claim asserted by the United States.
The said sum of $110,000 shall be deemed a trust fund received by the Secretary of State under the provisions of section 2668a of title 22, and shall be expended as therein provided. The said sum shall be deemed to constitute the fund of $110,000 received by the United States from the Iranian Government in four installments between December 24, 1924, and March 29, 1925, pursuant to the afore-mentioned notes, and deposited in the Treasury of the United States on June 24, 1925, which fund shall be deemed, insofar as the same may be necessary, to have been heretofore appropriated as a trust fund under section 2668a of title 22 and sections 1321 and 1322(a) of title 31. The Secretary of the Treasury shall make payments out of the said fund to or for the account of such persons, in such amounts, at such times, and on such terms, as the Secretary of State or his designee shall certify and the certificates of the Secretary of State or his designee issued hereunder shall be conclusive as to the propriety of payments so made. The expenditure of the said sum by the United States shall constitute full performance of the obligation of the United States to the Iranian Government or any other person arising out of the said notes and shall discharge the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to any accountability therefor.
