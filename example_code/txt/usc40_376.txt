In subsection (c)(1)(A)(ii), the words “where the acquisition of such facilities is the most cost-effective means for providing increased health services” are omitted as unnecessary because of the more narrow requirement that the Commission find that but for the acquisition of the facility, the health services would not be otherwise provided in the area served by the facility.
In subsection (f)(1), the words “After September 30, 1998” are omitted as obsolete.
