§ 1a–8. Maintenance management system(a) Implementation and elementsBeginning in fiscal year 1985, the National Park Service shall implement a maintenance management system into the maintenance and operations programs of the National Park System. For purposes of this section the term “maintenance management system” means a system that contains but is not limited to the following elements:(1) a work load inventory of assets including detailed information that quantifies for all assets (including but not limited to buildings, roads, utility systems, and grounds that must be maintained) the characteristics affecting the type of maintenance work performed;

(2) a set of maintenance tasks that describe the maintenance work in each unit of the National Park System;

(3) a description of work standards including frequency of maintenance, measurable quality standard to which assets should be maintained, methods for accomplishing work, required labor, equipment and material resources, and expected worker production for each maintenance task;

(4) a work program and performance budget which develops an annual work plan identifying maintenance needs and financial resources to be devoted to each maintenance task;

(5) a work schedule which identifies and prioritizes tasks to be done in a specific time period and specifies required labor resources;

(6) work orders specifying job authorizations and a record of work accomplished which can be used to record actual labor and material costs; and

(7) reports and special analyses which compare planned versus actual accomplishments and costs and can be used to evaluate maintenance operations.
