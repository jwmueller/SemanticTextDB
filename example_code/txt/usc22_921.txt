§ 1465e. Compensation for Cuban interference with broadcasting in United States(a) Interim assistance to United States broadcastersIt is the intent of the Congress that the Secretary of State should seek prompt and full settlement of United States claims against the Government of Cuba arising from Cuban interference with broadcasting in the United States. Pending the settlement of these claims, it is appropriate to provide some interim assistance to the United States broadcasters who are adversely affected by Cuban radio interference and who seek to assert their right to measures to counteract the effects of such interference.

Such expenses shall be limited to the costs of equipment replaced (less depreciation) and associated technical and engineering costs.
