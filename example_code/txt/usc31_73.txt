In this subchapter, the words “surviving spouse”, “spouse”, “surviving spouse’s”, and “parent” are substituted for “widow”, “wife”, “surviving widow’s”, and “mother”, respectively, because of 5:7202(c).
In clause (3), the words “or retired Comptroller General” are omitted as executed because a retired Comptroller General could elect survivor benefits and include retirement service only if the Comptroller General had retired by July 13, 1959. The word “total” is omitted as surplus. The words “complete months” are substituted for “twelfth parts thereof, excluding from the aggregate the fractional part of a month, if any” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “an individual is Comptroller General” are added for clarity.
