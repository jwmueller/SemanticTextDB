Historical and Revision Notes
senate report no. 95–989This section adopts the policy of section 82(c) of current law [section 402(c) of former title 11]. The only change in this section from section 82(c) is to conform the section to the style and cross-references of S. 2266.

house report no. 95–595This section adopts the policy of section 82(c) of current law [section 402(c) of former title 11]. The Usery case underlines the need for this limitation on the court’s powers. The only change in this section from section 82(c) is to conform the section to the style and cross-references of H.R. 8200. This section makes clear that the court may not interfere with the choices a municipality makes as to what services and benefits it will provide to its inhabitants.
