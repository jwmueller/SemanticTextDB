§ 5567. Settlement of accounts(a) The head of the agency concerned or his designee may settle the accounts of—(1) an employee for whose account payment has been made under sections 5562, 5563, and 5565 of this title; and

(2) a survivor of a casualty to a ship, station, or military installation which results in the loss or destruction of disbursing records.


That settlement is conclusive on the accounting officials of the United States in settling the accounts of disbursing officials.

(b) Payment or settlement of an account made pursuant to a report, determination, or finding of death may not be recovered or reopened because of a later report or determination which fixes a date of death. However, an account shall be reopened and settled on the basis of a date of death so fixed which is later than that used as a basis for earlier settlement.

(c) In settling the accounts of a disbursing official, he is entitled to credit for an erroneous payment or overpayment made by him in carrying out this subchapter, except section 5568, if there is no fraud or criminality by him. Recovery may not be made from an individual who authorizes a payment under this subchapter, except section 5568, if there is no fraud or criminality by him.

Only that portion of the source law which is applicable to civilian officers and employees and their dependents is codified in this section.
In subsection (a), the words “or his designee” are substituted for “or such person as he may designate”. The word “employee” is substituted for “persons”. The words “United States” are substituted for “Government” to conform to the style of this title.
In subsection (c), the words “in carrying out this subchapter, except section 5568” are substituted for “in carrying out the provisions of this Act, except sections 13, 16, 17, and 18”, since sections 16 and 17 are scheduled for repeal (see Table II) and section 18 was previously repealed. The words “under this subchapter, except section 5568” are substituted for “under such provisions” for the reasons stated in the preceding sentence.
Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
