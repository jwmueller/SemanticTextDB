(Added Pub. L. 100–370, § 1(d)(1)(A), July 19, 1988, 102 Stat. 841; amended Pub. L. 106–65, div. A, title X, § 1032(a)(1), Oct. 5, 1999, 113 Stat. 751; Pub. L. 111–350, § 5(b)(4), Jan. 4, 2011, 124 Stat. 3842.)

Historical and Revision NotesSection is based on Pub. L. 99–190, § 101(b) [title VIII, § 8009], Dec. 19, 1985, 99 Stat. 1185, 1204.
In two instances, the source law to be codified by the bill includes provisions that on their face require that the Department of Defense notify Congress of certain actions. These notification requirements were terminated by section 602 of the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 (Public Law 99–433), which terminated all recurring reporting requirements applicable to the Department of Defense except for those requirements that were specifically exempted in that section. The source law sections are sections 8009(c) and 8005(j) (proviso) of the FY86 defense appropriations Act (Public Law 99–190), enacted December 19, 1985, which would be codified as section 2201 of title 10 (by section 1(d) of the bill) and section 7313(a) of title 10 (by section 1(n) of the bill). In codifying the authorities provided the Department of Defense by these two provisions of law, the committee believes that it is appropriate to reinstate the congressional notification requirements that go with those authorities. These sections were recurring annual appropriation provisions for many years and were made permanent only months before the enactment of the 1986 Reorganization Act. It is the committee’s belief that the failure to exempt these provisions from the general reports termination provision was inadvertent and notes that the notification provisions had in fact previously applied to the Department of Defense for many years. The action of the committee restores the status quo as it existed before the Reorganization Act.
