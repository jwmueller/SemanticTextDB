In subsection (c), the words “Director of the Office of Management and Budget” are substituted for “Bureau of the Budget” in the Act of June 2, 1951 (ch. 121, 65 Stat. 59), because of sections 101 and 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (5 App. U.S.C.) and 31 U.S.C. ch. 5. The words “for the purposes of that appropriation” are omitted for clarity and for consistency in the subsection.
In subsection (d), the words “notwithstanding any other provisions of law” and “and consolidated with” are omitted as unnecessary.
In subsection (e), in paragraph (1), the words “Comptroller General” are substituted for “Government Accountability Office” for consistency in the revised title. Paragraph (3) is substituted for “(except in cases where section 1212 of this Appendix is applicable)” because section 1212 applies to all vessels under a construction-differential subsidy contract.
In subsection (f), the words “On and after June 20, 1956”, and the last proviso in the 4th complete par. at 70 Stat. 319 (46 App. U.S.C. 1241b note), are omitted as obsolete.
In subsection (g), the words “beginning July 1, 1956” and “after July 1, 1956” are omitted as obsolete.
