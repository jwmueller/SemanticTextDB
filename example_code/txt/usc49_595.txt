In subsection (a), the definitions apply to the entire chapter because of references in 15:1421–1431 applying 15:1391–1420 to 15:1421–1431. Before clause (1), the words “As used” are omitted as surplus. In clause (1), the text of 15:1391(10) and 49 App.:1655(a)(6)(A) is omitted as surplus because the complete name of the Secretary of Transportation is used the first time the term appears in a section. The words “selling and distributing” are substituted for “who is engaged in the sale and distribution of” to eliminate unnecessary words. The word “purposes” is omitted as surplus. In clause (3), the words “selling and distributing” are substituted for “engaged in the sale and distribution of” to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (5)(A), the words “manufacturing or assembling” are substituted for “engaged in the manufacturing or assembling of” to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (7), the words “physician or other duly” and “drivers, passengers, and other” are omitted as surplus. In clause (8), the words “is also protected” and “to persons” are omitted as unnecessary. In clause (9), the words “which is practicable, which meets the need for motor vehicle safety and which provides objective criteria” are omitted as unnecessary because of 15:1392(a) which is restated in section 30111 of the revised title. In clauses (10) and (11), the words “the Northern Mariana Islands” are added because of section 502(a)(2) of the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America, as enacted by the Act of March 24, 1976 (Public Law 94–241, 90 Stat. 268), and as proclaimed to be in effect by the President on January 9, 1978 (Proc. No. 4534, Oct. 24, 1977, 42 F.R. 56593). The words “the Canal Zone” are omitted because of the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977. In clause (10), the word “means” is substituted for “includes” as being more appropriate. The words “a State of the United States” are substituted for “each of the several States” for consistency. The words “the Commonwealth of” are omitted as surplus. In clause (11), the word “Federal” is omitted as surplus. The words “of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico” are omitted as unnecessary because the district court of Puerto Rico is a district court of the United States under 28:119.
In subsection (b)(1), before clause (A), the words “The term” and “the term” are omitted as surplus. In clause (B), the words “of a motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment” are added for clarity. In clause (E), the words “to be” are added for consistency. The words “marketed under such brand name” are omitted as surplus. In clause (F), the words “a motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter” are added for clarity and consistency. The word “noncompliance” is substituted for “failure to comply” for consistency in the chapter. In clause (G), the words “(rather than the manufacturer of such equipment)” are omitted as surplus. The words “deemed to be” are substituted for “considered” for consistency. In clause (H), the words “which have been” are omitted as surplus.
Subsection (b)(2) is substituted for “Except as otherwise provided in regulations of the Secretary” for clarity and because of the restatement.
