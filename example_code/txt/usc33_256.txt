Transfer of Functions
“Coast Guard” and “Coast Guard vessel” substituted in text for “Revenue Cutter Service” and “revenue cutter”, respectively, the Revenue Cutter Service and Life-Saving Service having been combined to form the Coast Guard by act Jan. 28, 1915, ch. 20, § 1, 38 Stat. 800. That act was repealed by act Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, § 20, 63 Stat. 561, section 1 of which reestablished the Coast Guard by enacting Title 14, Coast Guard.
“Secretary of Transportation” substituted for “Secretary of the Treasury” in provision covering enforcement of rules and regulations by Coast Guard pursuant to section 6(b)(1) of Pub. L. 89–670, which transferred to Secretary of Transportation functions, powers, and duties of Secretary of the Treasury and of other offices and officers of Department of the Treasury relating to Coast Guard. Section 6(b)(2) of Pub. L. 89–670, however, provided that notwithstanding such transfer of functions, the Coast Guard shall operate as part of the Navy in time of war or when President directs as provided in section 3 of Title 14, Coast Guard. See section 108 of Title 49, Transportation. For subsequent transfers relating to the Secretary of Transportation and the Coast Guard, see below.
