(B) Public interest factorsIn making a decision under subparagraph (A) regarding the public interest, the administering authority shall take into account—(i) whether, based upon the relative impact on consumer prices and the availability of supplies of the merchandise, the agreement would have a greater adverse impact on United States consumers than the imposition of countervailing duties;

(ii) the relative impact on the international economic interests of the United States; and

(iii) the relative impact on the competitiveness of the domestic industry producing the like merchandise, including any such impact on employment and investment in that industry.


(C) Prior consultationsBefore making a decision under subparagraph (A) regarding the public interest, the administering authority shall, to the extent practicable, consult with—(i) potentially affected consuming industries; and
