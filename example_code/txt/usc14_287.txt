(2) compensation for towage and salvage services, including contract salvage, rendered to a vessel in the Coast Guard service or to other property under the jurisdiction of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating; or

(3) damage caused by a maritime tort committed by an agent or employee of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating or by property under the jurisdiction of that Department.


(b) Upon acceptance of payment by the claimant, the settlement or compromise of a claim under this section is final and conclusive notwithstanding any other law.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 548; Pub. L. 86–533, § 1(3)(A), June 29, 1960, 74 Stat. 245; Pub. L. 92–417, § 2(a), Aug. 29, 1972, 86 Stat. 655.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 71 (June 15, 1936, ch. 550, 49 Stat. 1514; July 1, 1944, ch. 373, title VII, § 711, 58 Stat. 714; Aug. 13, 1946, ch. 958, § 5, 60 Stat. 1051).
This section closely parallels title 46, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§ 797, 798, which authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to negotiate amicable settlement of claims against the United States arising out of the operation of Naval vessels. It grants similar authority to the Secretary of the Treasury in relation to vessels in the Coast Guard service, and the limiting amount is reduced from $1,000,000 to $25,000. It is believed that this section will work to the benefit of the Government by reducing civil litigation and the number of claims which must presently be certified to Congress for appropriations in order to make settlement. It will greatly expedite the settlement of just claims and should result in a considerable overall savings to the Government. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.
