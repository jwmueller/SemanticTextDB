“SEC. 102. POLICY.“It is declared to be national policy that the United States should—“(1) rededicate itself to the goal of leadership in critical areas of space science, space exploration, and space commercialization;

“(2) increase its commitment of budgetary resources for the space program to reverse the dramatic decline in real spending for such program since the achievements of the Apollo moon program;

“(3) ensure that the long-range environmental impact of all activities carried out under this title [see Tables for classification] are fully understood and considered;

“(4) promote and support efforts to advance scientific understanding by conducting or otherwise providing for research on environmental problems, including global change, ozone depletion, acid precipitation, deforestation, and smog;

“(5) forge a robust national space program that maintains a healthy balance between manned and unmanned space activities and recognizes the mutually reinforcing benefits of both;

“(6) maintain an active fleet of space shuttle orbiters, including an adequate provision of structural spare parts, and evolve the orbiter design to improve safety and performance, and reduce operational costs;

“(7) sustain a mixed fleet by utilizing commercial expendable launch vehicle services to the fullest extent practicable;

“(8) support an aggressive program of research and development designed to enhance the United States preeminence in launch vehicles;

“(9) continue and complete on schedule the development and deployment of a permanently manned, fully capable, space station;

“(10) develop an advanced, high pressure space suit to support extravehicular activity that will be required for Space Station Freedom when Assembly Complete is reached;

“(11) establish a dual capability for logistics and resupply of the space station utilizing the space shuttle and expendable launch vehicles, including commercial services if available;

“(12) continue to seek opportunities for international cooperation in space and fully support international cooperative agreements;

“(13) maintain an aggressive program of aeronautical research and technology development designed to enhance the United States preeminence in civil and military aviation and improve the safety and efficiency of the United States air transportation system;

“(14) conduct a program of technology maturation, including flight demonstration in 1997, to prove the feasibility of an air-breathing, hypersonic aerospace plane capable of single-stage-to-orbit operation and hypersonic cruise in the atmosphere;

“(15) seek innovative technologies that will make possible advanced human exploration initiatives, such as the establishment of a lunar base and the succeeding mission to Mars, and provide high yield technology advancements for the national economy; and

“(16) enhance the human resources of the Nation and the quality of education.”
