The words “under this subchapter” are added for clarity. The words “has exclusive jurisdiction of a civil action under this section” are substituted for “Action for the resolution of such a case shall be brought solely in” for clarity and consistency. The words “Court of Federal Claims” are substituted for “Claims Court” to reflect the change of name of the Court by section 902(b) of the Federal Courts Administration Act of 1992 (Public Law 102–572, 106 Stat. 4516).
