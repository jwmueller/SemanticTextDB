The status of former section 63 of this title had been doubtful. At different times it had been held to have been repealed, superseded, and superseded only in part by former section 64 of this title which related to the same subject. See American T. Co. v. Grut, C.C.A. 1935, 80 F.2d 155; Miller v. Hamner, C.C.A. 1920, 269 F. 891; and First Nat. Bank v. First Nat. Bank, D.C. 1926, 14 F.2d 129.
