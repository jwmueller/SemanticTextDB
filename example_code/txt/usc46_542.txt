In subsection (a), the word “shall” is substituted for “is authorized and directed”, and the words “prescribe regulations” are substituted for “make rules and regulations”, for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words. The text of 46 App. U.S.C. 1710a(h), insofar as it relates to 46 App. U.S.C. 876(a)(2), is omitted as unnecessary because this chapter already provides for the same remedies as those authorized by the omitted provision.
In subsection (b), the words “on the petition of any person, including another component of the United States Government” are substituted for “pursuant to a petition. Any person, including a common carrier, tramp operator, bulk operator, shipper, shippers’ association, ocean transportation intermediary, marine terminal operator, or any component of the Government of the United States, may file a petition for relief under subsection (a)(2) of this section.” for consistency with section 42302(b) of the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words.
