The words “The Secretary of Transportation may pay . . . only when” are substituted for “An air carrier shall not receive . . . unless” for clarity. The words “approved by the Secretary” are substituted for “complies with regulations or orders issued by the Secretary governing the filing and approval” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “The policy or plan must be sufficient to pay . . . but not more than the amount of the policy or plan limits” are substituted for “in the amount prescribed by the Secretary which are conditioned to pay, within the amount of such insurance, amounts” because of the restatement. The words “for which such air carrier may become liable” are omitted as unnecessary. The word “individual” is substituted for “person” because it is more precise. The word “operation” is substituted for “operation or maintenance” because it is inclusive.
