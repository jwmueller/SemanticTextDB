Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 90 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees, section 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 92 of title 44, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Printing and Documents (Aug. 7, 1882, ch. 433, § 1, 22 Stat. 336; Jan. 12, 1895, ch. 23, § 74, 28 Stat. 620; June 20, 1936, ch. 630, §§ 11, 12, 49 Stat. 1552, 1553; May 14, 1940, ch. 189, title IV, 54 Stat. 210; June 28, 1941, ch. 258, title IV, 55 Stat. 301; July 2, 1942, ch. 472, title IV, 56 Stat. 504; June 28, 1943, ch. 173, title II, § 201, 57 Stat. 243; June 26, 1944, ch. 277, § 203, 58 Stat. 358; May 21, 1945, ch. 129, title IV, 59 Stat. 200; July 5, 1946, ch. 541, title IV, 60 Stat. 480).
Section consolidates section 90 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., providing that “statutes” shall be delivered to successors of United States attorneys and clerks and provisions of section 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring that all lawbooks for judges and others shall be marked as property of the United States and shall be transmitted to their successors, with section 92 of title 44, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to transmittal of “Government publications.”
Words “All Government publications and lawbooks” and “furnished under this chapter” were used to cover “all statutes” and “The Federal Reporter and continuations thereto.”
Words “justices and judges of the United States” were substituted for “United States judges” in conformity with uniform use of the phrase to describe all members of the Federal judiciary. Similar provisions in sections 334 and 377 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were therefore omitted as covered by this revised section.
Other provisions of said section 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted. (See reviser’s note under section 413 of this title.)
The words “permanent or bound” were inserted in the last sentence of the revised section to obviate the wasteful practice under existing law of marking temporary pamphlets.
Changes were made in phraseology.

Senate Revision AmendmentAs finally enacted, part of act July 9, 1947, ch. 211, title IV, 61 Stat. 306, which was classified to Title 28, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 530, became one of the sources of this section and was accordingly included in the schedule of repeals by Senate amendment. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.

Amendments1962—Pub. L. 87–845 substituted “furnished to justices, judges, clerks of courts, and United States attorneys of the United States and its territories and possessions, and other officers of the United States or an agency thereof” for “furnished to justices and judges of the United States and of the Territorial Courts, United States attorneys, clerks of courts, and other officers of the United States”.

Effective Date of 1962 AmendmentPub. L. 87–845, § 25, Oct. 18, 1962, 76A Stat. 701, provided that: “This Act [enacting section 4210 of Title 18, Crimes and Criminal Procedure, and section 858 of Title 50, War and National Defense, and amending this section, sections 547, 1404, and 1406 of this title, section 14 of Title 18, section 1934 of Title 22, Foreign Relations and Intercourse, section 196 of Title 24, Hospitals and Asylums, and sections 191a and 191b of Title 50] takes effect January 2, 1963.
