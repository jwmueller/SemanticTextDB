It is unnecessary to include a reference to section 541 of title 10, since that section does not derogate from the authority granted in this section.
The change reflects the opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Air Force (July 19, 1957) that the words “from and after the date of the accrediting of said academies” in the source law for section 9353(a) (Act of May 25, 1933, ch. 37 (48 Stat. 73), as amended) were a condition precedent to the authority to grant degrees and should not have been omitted.
