shall be paid an annuity by the Secretary concerned unless she is eligible to receive an annuity under the Survivor Benefit Plan established pursuant to clause (3) of the first section of this Act [this subchapter]. However, such a person who is the widow of a retired officer of the Public Health Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and who would otherwise be eligible for an annuity under this section except that she does not qualify for the pension described in clause (2) of this subsection because the service of her deceased spouse is not considered active duty under section 101(21) of title 38, United States Code, is entitled to an annuity under this section.

“(c) The amount of an annuity payable under this section, although counted as income in determining the amount of any pension described in subsection (a)(2) of this section, shall not be considered to affect the eligiblity [sic] of the recipient of such annuity for such pension, even though, as a result of including the amount of the annuity as income, no amount of such pension is due.

“(d) Subsection 1450(i) and section 1453 as added to title 10, United States Code, by clause 3 of the first section of this Act, are applicable to persons covered by this section.

“(e)(1) Payment of annuities under this section shall be made by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.

“(2) The Secretary concerned shall annually transfer to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs such amounts as may be necessary for payments by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under this section and for costs of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in administering this section. Such transfers shall be made from amounts that would otherwise be used for payment of annuities by the Secretary concerned under this section. The authority to make such a transfer is in addition to any other authority of the Secretary concerned to transfer funds for a purpose other than the purpose for which the funds were originally made available. In the case of a transfer by the Secretary of a military department, the provisions of section 2215 of title 10, United States Code, do not apply.
