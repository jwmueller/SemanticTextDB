“It is the sense of Congress that the President—“(1) should call on the pertinent member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to meet or exceed their pledges for an annual increase in defense spending during fiscal years 1984 and 1985 of at least 3 percent real growth; and

“(2) should call on Japan to further increase its defense spending during fiscal years 1984 and 1985;


in furtherance of increased unity, equitable sharing of the common defense burden, and international sta­bility.”
