DerivationU.S. CodeRevised Statutes andStatutes at Large


 28 U.S.C. 556.[None].


The words “may not” are substituted for “shall not”.

1948 ActPrior section 556.—Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 395 and 396 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§ 273, 274, 36 Stat. 1164).
Section consolidates parts of sections 395 and 396 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Similar provisions in said sections, relating to clerks, are incorporated in section 955 of this title.
The revised section substitutes, as simpler and more appropriate, the prohibition against practice of law “in any court of the United States” for the more involved language of section 395 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which provided that no clerks or marshals, deputies, or assistants within the district for which appointed “shall act as solicitor, proctor, attorney or counsel, in any cause depending in any of said courts, or in any district for which he is acting as such officer.”
Provisions of section 396 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for striking the name of an offender from the roll of attorneys and for recommendation of dismissal, were omitted as unnecessary and as covered by section 541 of this title.
Changes were made in phraseology.
