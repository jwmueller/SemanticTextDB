“Sec. 304. (a) The Secretary shall pay to each State educational agency having an application approved under section 303 the amount which that State is entitled to receive under this title.

“(b) If a State is prohibited by law from providing public educational services for children enrolled in elementary and secondary nonpublic schools, as required by section 303(a)(6), or if the Secretary determines that a local educational agency has substantially failed or is unwilling to provide for the participation on an equitable basis of children enrolled in such schools, the Secretary may waive such requirement and shall arrange for the provision of services to such children through arrangements which shall be subject to the requirements of this Act.
