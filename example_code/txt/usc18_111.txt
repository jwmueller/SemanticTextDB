(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 697; May 24, 1949, ch. 139, § 5, 63 Stat. 90; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(G), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision Notes
1948 ActBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 523 (Mar. 1, 1911, ch. 187, 36 Stat. 963; Aug. 24, 1912, ch. 387, § 1, 37 Stat. 512; Jan. 28, 1915, ch. 20, § 1, 38 Stat. 800).
Words “guilty of a misdemeanor”, following “shall be”, were omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “misdemeanor” in section 1 of this title. (See reviser’s note under section 212 of this title.)
Changes were made in phraseology.

1949 ActThis section [section 5] substitutes, in section 244 of title 18, U.S.C., “any of the armed forces of the United States” for the enumeration of specific branches and thereby includes the Air Force, formerly part of the Army. This clarification is necessary because of the establishment of the Air Force as a separate branch of the Armed Forces by the act of July 26, 1947.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $500”.
1949—Act May 24, 1949, substituted “any of the armed forces of the United States” for enumeration of the specific branches.
