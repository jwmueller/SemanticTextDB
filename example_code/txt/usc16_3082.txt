Act Jan. 24, 1905, and act June 29, 1906, are identical in language throughout, except that the earlier act authorizes the setting aside of areas in Wichita National Forest, while the latter authorizes areas in Grand Canyon National Forest. The two acts have been combined to form this section and sections 685 and 686 of this title.
