§ 471. Attendance at professional meetings
Coast Guard personnel may be directed to attend meetings of technical, professional, scientific, and other similar organizations and may be reimbursed for expenses thereby incurred at the rates authorized by law.
(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 532.)

Historical and Revision NotesIt is believed that the authority contained in this section will greatly benefit the Government in providing better trained personnel. A similar provision was enacted for personnel of the Navy in 1946 (see title 5, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 421c). 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.
