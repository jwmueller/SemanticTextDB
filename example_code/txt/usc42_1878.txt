(3) in the case of an individual who would otherwise satisfy subsection (f) of this section but does not establish his entitlement to hospital insurance benefits until after the last day of his initial enrollment period (as defined in subsection (d) of this section), his enrollment shall be deemed to have occurred on the first day of the earlier of the then current or immediately succeeding general enrollment period (as defined in subsection (e) of this section).
