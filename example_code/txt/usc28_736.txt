(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 972.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 870 (R.S. § 1001; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§ 117, 289, 36 Stat. 1131, 1167; Jan. 31, 1928, ch. 14, § 1, 45 Stat. 54; June 19, 1934, ch. 653, § 7, 48 Stat. 1109).
Section 870 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., applied only to the Supreme Court and district courts. The revised section applies to all courts.
Words “process or the institution or prosecution of any proceeding” were substituted for “appeal, or other process in law, admiralty, or equity.”
Word “agency” was substituted for “any corporation all the stock of which is beneficially owned by the United States, either directly or indirectly”, in view of the creation of many independent governmental agencies since the enactment of the original law on which this section is based.
Changes were made in phraseology.
