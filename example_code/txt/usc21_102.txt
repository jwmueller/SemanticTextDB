References in TextSection 2223 of this title, referred to in par. (e), was in the original “section 204 of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act”, meaning section 204 of Pub. L. 111–353, which enacted section 2223 of this title and amended this section and section 381 of this title.
Section 353c of this title, referred to in par. (kk), was in the original a reference to section 503B of act June 25, 1938, and was translated as if it referred to section 503C of that Act, to reflect the probable intent of Congress and the renumbering of section 503B as 503C by Pub. L. 113–54, title I, § 102(a)(1), Nov. 27, 2013, 127 Stat. 587, and its transfer to section 353c of this title. A new section 503B, which was enacted by section 102(a)(2) of Pub. L. 113–54, is classified to section 353b of this title and does not relate to television advertisements.
