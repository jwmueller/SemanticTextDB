“SEC. 1121. DEPLOYABILITY RATING SYSTEM.“The Secretary of the Army shall modify the readiness rating system for units of the Army Reserve and Army National Guard to ensure that the rating system provides an accurate assessment of the deployability of a unit and those shortfalls of a unit that require the provision of additional resources. In making such modifications, the Secretary shall ensure that the unit readiness rating system is designed so—“(1) that the personnel readiness rating of a unit reflects—“(A) both the percentage of the overall personnel requirement of the unit that is manned and deployable and the fill and deployability rate for critical occupational specialties necessary for the unit to carry out its basic mission requirements; and

“(B) the number of personnel in the unit who are qualified in their primary military occupational specialty; and


“(2) that the equipment readiness assessment of a unit—“(A) documents all equipment required for deployment;

“(B) reflects only that equipment that is directly possessed by the unit;

“(C) specifies the effect of substitute items; and

“(D) assesses the effect of missing components and sets on the readiness of major equipments items.
