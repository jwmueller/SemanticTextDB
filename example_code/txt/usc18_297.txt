Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 244, 662e, 665 (Feb. 6, 1905, ch. 454, § 2, 33 Stat. 698; Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §§ 138, 139, 35 Stat. 1113; Mar. 22, 1934, ch. 73, § 4, 48 Stat. 456).
Sections 244, 662e and 665 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were consolidated. The two latter sections merely extended application of the former. This section has been greatly condensed by changes in phraseology which do not affect the substance.
Enumeration of “marshal, deputy marshal, ministerial officer, or other person,” was omitted as surplusage.
Provision making section applicable to cases of prisoners in custody pending extradition or removal proceedings as well as prisoners convicted of offenses against the United States was likewise omitted as unnecessary.
Changes in phraseology were made.

Senate Revision AmendmentThe text of this section was changed by Senate amendment in view of the act of June 21, 1947, ch. 111, 61 Stat. 134, which, by amending section 244 of Title 18, U.S.C., became an additional source of this section. The amendment constitutes the last clause of this section. See Senate Report No. 1620, amendment No. 8, 80th Cong.

Amendments1996—Pub. L. 104–132 substituted “5 years” for “two years”.
1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $2,000” after “escape, shall be” and for “fined not more than $500” after “he shall be”.
