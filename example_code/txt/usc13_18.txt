Section consolidates section 5 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., with section 6 of such title.

The provision in section 5 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., excepting unskilled laborers from the requirements for citizenship, was omitted as superseded and covered by the Classification Act of 1949 (5 U.S.C., 1952 ed., ch. 21).
The provision that appointments and compensation shall be subject to the Classification Act of 1949 is new but is in accordance with existing law. See chapter 21 of title 5, U.S.C., 1952 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees.
