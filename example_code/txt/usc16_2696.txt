“(b) In return for the Nursery Site properties, Skamania County is authorized and directed to negotiate with the Forest Service the conveyance of approximately 120 acres of high biodiversity, special management lands located near Table Mountain within the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, title to which must be acceptable to the Secretary of Agriculture.

“(c) Before this exchange can occur, it must be of equal value and the Secretary and the Skamania County Board of Commissioners must agree on the exact parcels of land to be included in the exchange. An agreement signed by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Skamania County Board of Commissioners describing the properties involved and a certification that the exchange is of equal value must be completed no later than September 30, 1999.

“(d) During this two-year negotiating period, the Wind River Nursery property shall not be conveyed to another party. The Forest Service shall maintain the site in a tenantable condition.

“(e) Except as provided herein, the exchange shall be for equal value in accordance with land exchange authorities applicable to the National Forest System.

“(f) The Secretary is directed to equalize values by not only cash and exchange of lands, easements, reservations, and other interests in lands, but also by full value credit for such services as Skamania County provides to the Gifford Pinchot and Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area and as the Secretary and Skamania County deem appropriate. The Secretary may accept services in lieu of cash when the Secretary can discern cash value for the services and when the Secretary determines such services would provide direct benefits to lands and resources and users of such lands and resources under the jurisdiction of the Secretary.

“(g) Any cash equalization which Skamania County elects to make may be made up to 50 percent of the fair market value of the Federal property, and such cash equalization may be made in installments over a period not to exceed 25 years.

“(i) This authorization is predicated on Skamania County’s Board of Commissioners commitment to give foremost consideration to preservation of the overall integrity of the site and conservation of the educational and research potential of the site, including providing for access to and assurance of the continued administration and operation of forestry research on the adjacent Thornton Munger Research Natural Area.

“(j) The Secretary is further directed to cooperate with Skamania County to address applicable Federal and State environmental laws.

“(k) Notwithstanding the processes involved with the National Environmental Policy Act [of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.] and the State Environmental Policy Act, should the Secretary of Agriculture and the Skamania County Board of Commissioners fail to reach an agreement on an equal value exchange defined under the terms of this legislation by September 30, 1999, the Wind River Nursery Site shall remain under Forest Service ownership and be maintained by the Forest Service in a tenantable condition.”
