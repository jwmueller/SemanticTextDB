§ 1772a. Gifts; acceptance of conditional gifts; deposit
The Board is authorized to accept gifts of money made unconditionally by will or otherwise for the carrying out of any of the functions under this chapter. A conditional gift of money made by will or otherwise for such purposes may be accepted and used in accordance with its conditions, but no such gift shall be accepted which is conditioned upon any expenditure not to be met therefrom or from income thereof unless the Board determines that supplementation of such gift from the fees it may expend pursuant to sections 1755 and 1756 of this title or from any funds appropriated pursuant to section 1766(f)(2)(C) of this title for the purpose of making such expenditure will not adversely affect the sound administration of this chapter. Any such gift shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States for the account of the Administration and may be expended in accordance with section 1755 of this title or as provided in the preceding sentence.
