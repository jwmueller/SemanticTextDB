“SEC. 4. CONDEMNATION OF SLAVERY, OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, AND TACTICS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN.“The Congress hereby—“(1) condemns—“(A) violations of human rights on all sides of the conflict in Sudan;

“(B) the Government of Sudan’s overall human rights record, with regard to both the prosecution of the war and the denial of basic human and political rights to all Sudanese;

“(C) the ongoing slave trade in Sudan and the role of the Government of Sudan in abetting and tolerating the practice;

“(D) the Government of Sudan’s use and organization of ‘murahalliin’ or ‘mujahadeen’, Popular Defense Forces, and regular Sudanese Army units into organized and coordinated raiding and slaving parties in Bahr al Ghazal, the Nuba Mountains, and the Upper Nile and the Blue Nile regions; and

“(E) aerial bombardment of civilian targets that is sponsored by the Government of Sudan; and


“(2) recognizes that, along with selective bans on air transport relief flights by the Government of Sudan, the use of raiding and slaving parties is a tool for creating food shortages and is used as a systematic means to destroy the societies, culture, and economies of the Dinka, Nuer, and Nuba peoples in a policy of low-intensity ethnic cleansing.
