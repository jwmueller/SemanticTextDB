Each agency shall provide direction to such institutions regarding additions to general reserves maintained by each banking institution for potential loan losses and special reserves required by such agency arising from such review.


(b) Determination of institutional exposure to riskIn determining the exposure of an institution to risk for purposes of subsection (a) of this section, the appropriate Federal banking agency—(1) shall determine whether any country exposure that is, and has been for at least 2 years, rated in the category “Other Transfer Risk Problems” or the category “Substandard” by the Interagency Country Exposure Review Committee should be reevaluated;

(B) secured, in whole or in part, by appropriate collateral for payment of interest or principal;

Congressional FindingsPub. L. 101–240, title IV, § 402(a), Dec. 19, 1989, 103 Stat. 2501, provided that: 
“The Congress finds that—
“(1) since the adoption of the International Lending Supervision Act of 1983 [12 U.S.C. 3901 et seq.], the credit quality of loans by United States banking institutions to highly indebted countries has deteriorated and the prospects for full repayment of such loans have diminished;

“(2) in general during this period, the level of country exposure and transfer risk associated with loans by United States banking institutions to highly indebted countries has not been adequately reflected in the reserve levels established by many individual United States banking institutions or the reserve requirements imposed by Federal banking agencies pursuant to such Act;

“(3) during the last 3 years and particularly in recent months, United States banking institutions have increased their reserves for possible losses from loans to highly indebted countries but such reserves remain, in some cases, significantly lower than reserves established by banking institutions in a number of foreign countries and may not be adequate to deal with potential risks; and

“(4) in order to fulfill the purposes of such Act, the Federal banking agencies should take a more active role in reviewing reserve levels established by United States banking institutions for potential losses from loans to highly indebted countries and in requiring appropriate levels of both special and general reserves to reflect the increased risk of such loans.”
