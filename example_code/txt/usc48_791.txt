“Section 351“(a) The Government of the United States and the Government of the Marshall Islands or the Federated States of Micronesia shall establish two Joint Committees empowered to consider disputes under the implementation of this Title and its related agreements.

“(b) The membership of each Joint Committee shall comprise selected senior officials of each of the two participating Governments. The senior United States military commander in the Pacific area shall be the senior United States member of each Joint Committee. For the meetings of each Joint Committee, each of the two participating Governments may designate additional or alternate representatives as appropriate for the subject matter under consideration.

“(c) Unless otherwise mutually agreed, each Joint Committee shall meet semi-annually at a time and place to be designated, after appropriate consultation, by the Government of the United States. A Joint Committee also shall meet promptly upon request of either of its members. Upon notification by the Government of the United States, the Joint Committees so notified shall meet promptly in a combined session to consider matters within the jurisdiction of more than one Joint Committee. Each Joint Committee shall follow such procedures, including the establishment of functional subcommittees, as the members may from time to time agree.

“(d) Unresolved issues in each Joint Committee shall be referred to the Governments concerned for resolution, and the Government of the Marshall Islands or the Federated States of Micronesia shall be afforded, on an expeditious basis, an opportunity to raise its concerns with the United States Secretary of Defense personally regarding any unresolved issue which threatens its continued association with the Government of the United States.
