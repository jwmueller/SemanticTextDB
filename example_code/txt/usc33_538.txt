In order to facilitate the United States in the acquisition of flowage rights and rights-of-way for levee foundations, the Secretary of the Army is authorized to enter into agreements with the States or with local levee districts, boards, commissions, or other agencies for the acquisition and transfer to the United States of such flowage rights and levee rights-of-way, and for the reimbursement of such States or local levee districts, boards, commissions, or other agencies, for the cost thereof at prices previously agreed upon between the Secretary of the Army and the governing authority of such agencies, within the maximum limitations hereinafter prescribed: Provided, That no money appropriated under the authority of sections 702g–1 and 702k–1 of this title shall be expended upon the construction of the Eudora Floodway, the Morganza Floodway, the back protection levee extending north from the Eudora Floodway, or the levees extending from the head of the Morganza Floodway to the head of and down the east bank of the Atchafalaya River to the intersection of said Morganza Floodway until 75 per centum of the value of the flowage rights and rights-of-way for levee foundations, as estimated by the Chief of Engineers, shall have been acquired or options or assurances satisfactory to the Chief of Engineers shall have been obtained for the Eudora Floodway, the Morganza Floodway, and the area lying between said back protection levee and the present front line levees: Provided further, That easements required in said areas in connection with roads and other public utilities owned by States or political subdivisions thereof shall be provided without cost to the United States upon the condition, that the United States shall provide suitable crossings, including surfacing of like character, over floodway guide-line levees in said areas for all improved roads now constituting a part of the State highway system, and shall repair all damage done to said highways within the said floodways by the actual use of such floodways for diversion: Provided further, That when such portion of said rights as to all of said areas shall have been acquired or obtained and when said easements required in connection with roads and other public utilities owned by States or political subdivisions thereof have been provided as hereinabove set forth, construction of said flood-control works in said areas shall be undertaken according to the engineering recommendations of the Report of the Chief of Engineers dated February 12, 1935 (House Committee on Flood Control Document Numbered 1, Seventy-fourth Congress, first session), and the Secretary of the Army shall cause proceedings to be instituted for the condemnation of the remainder of said rights and easements, as are needed and cannot be secured by agreement, in accordance with section 702d of this title: Provided further, That in no event and under no circumstances shall any of the additional money appropriated under the authority of sections 702g–1 and 702k–1 be expended for the acquisition of said 75 per centum of the flowage rights and rights-of-way hereinabove contemplated in excess of $20,000,000: Provided further, That the Chief of Engineers is authorized, out of the funds herein authorized to be appropriated, to purchase flowage easements over lands and properties in the floodway west of the Atchafalaya River and lying above the approximate latitude of Krotz Springs: Provided further, That none of such easements in said West Atchafalaya Floodway shall be purchased until options covering at least 75 per centum of the total value of such easements as estimated by the Chief of Engineers shall have been obtained at prices deemed reasonable by the Chief of Engineers and not exceeding in the aggregate $2,250,000 for said 75 per centum of said easements with respect to the floodway west of the Atchafalaya River: Provided further, That easements required in said West Atchafalaya Floodway in connection with roads and other public utilities owned by States or other political subdivisions shall be provided without cost to the United States upon condition that the United States shall provide suitable crossings, including surfacing of like character, over floodway guide-line levees for all improved roads in said West Atchafalaya Floodway now constituting a part of the State highway system and shall repair all damage done to said highways within said West Atchafalaya Floodway by the actual use of such floodway for diversion: Provided further, That no flowage easements shall be paid for by the United States over properties subject to frequent overflow in the Atchafalaya Basin below the approximate latitude of Krotz Springs: Provided further, That payment for rights-of-way, easements, and flowage rights acquired under this section, or reimbursement to the States or local interests furnishing them, shall be made as soon as the Chief of Engineers is satisfied that such rights-of-way, easements, or flowage rights have been acquired in conformity with local custom or legal procedure in such matters; and, thereafter, no liability of any kind shall attach to or rest upon the United States for any further damage by reason of diversions or flood waters: And provided further, That if the Secretary of Agriculture shall determine to acquire any of the properties within the floodways herein referred to, for national forests, wildlife refuges, or other purposes of his Department, the Secretary of the Army may, upon recommendation by the Chief of Engineers, in lieu of acquiring flowage rights, advance to or reimburse the said Secretary of Agriculture sums equal to those that would otherwise be used for the purchase of easements desired by the Department of the Army and the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to use these sums for the purpose of acquiring properties in the floodways in question.
