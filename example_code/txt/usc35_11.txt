Historical and Revision NotesBased on Title 35, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 2 (R.S. 476, amended (1) Feb. 15, 1916, ch. 22, § 1, 39 Stat. 8, (2) Feb. 14, 1927, ch. 139, § 1, 44 Stat. 1098, (3) Apr. 11, 1930, ch. 132, § 1, 46 Stat. 155).
The temporary designation of the assistant commissioner as Commissioner in case of a vacancy in office is added. This will eliminate complications since present applicable general statutes (5 U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 7) permit a vacancy to be temporarily filled only for not more than 30 days.
Changes in language are made. “Assistant commissioners” is used in the second sentence (and elsewhere in the bill) as referring to all three assistants.
This entire title is subject to Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1950 (64 Stat. 1263) which vests all functions of the Patent Office in the Secretary of Commerce and authorizes delegation by him. It has been found impractical to so word the various sections of the title, and a general provision has been inserted as the second paragraph of this section of the bill, leaving the wording of various sections of the title in terms of officers previously specified and to whom the functions presently stand delegated.
