Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 80 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 35, 35 Stat. 1095; Oct. 23, 1918, ch. 194, 40 Stat. 1015; June 18, 1934, ch. 587, 48 Stat. 996; Apr. 4, 1938, ch. 69, 52 Stat. 197).
Section 80 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was divided into two parts.
The provision relating to false claims was incorporated in section 287 of this title.
Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “principal” in section 2 of this title.
Words “or any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder” in said section 80 were omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “agency” in section 6 of this title.
In addition to minor changes of phraseology, the maximum term of imprisonment was changed from 10 to 5 years to be consistent with comparable sections. (See reviser’s note under section 287 of this title.)

L. 108–458 substituted “be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years or, if the offense involves international or domestic terrorism (as defined in section 2331), imprisoned not more than 8 years, or both” for “be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both” in concluding provisions.
1996—Pub. L. 104–292 reenacted section catchline without change and amended text generally.
