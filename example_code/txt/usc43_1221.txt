Congressional Findings and Declaration of PolicyPub. L. 100–241, § 2, Feb. 3, 1988, 101 Stat. 1788, provided that: 
“The Congress finds and declares that—
“(1) the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [this chapter] was enacted in 1971 to achieve a fair and just settlement of all aboriginal land and hunting and fishing claims by Natives and Native groups of Alaska with maximum participation by Natives in decisions affecting their rights and property;

“(2) the settlement enabled Natives to participate in the subsequent expansion of Alaska’s economy, encouraged efforts to address serious health and welfare problems in Native villages, and sparked a resurgence of interest in the cultural heritage of the Native peoples of Alaska;

“(3) despite these achievements and Congress’s desire that the settlement be accomplished rapidly without litigation and in conformity with the real economic and social needs of Natives, the complexity of the land conveyance process and frequent and costly litigation have delayed implementation of the settlement and diminished its value;

“(4) Natives have differing opinions as to whether the Native Corporation, as originally structured by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, is well adapted to the reality of life in Native villages and to the continuation of traditional Native cultural values;

“(5) to ensure the continued success of the settlement and to guarantee Natives continued participation in decisions affecting their rights and property, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act must be amended to enable the shareholders of each Native Corporation to structure the further implementation of the settlement in light of their particular circumstances and needs;

“(6) among other things, the shareholders of each Native Corporation must be permitted to decide—“(A) when restrictions on alienation of stock issued as part of the settlement should be terminated, and

“(B) whether Natives born after December 18, 1971, should participate in the settlement;


“(7) by granting the shareholders of each Native Corporation options to structure the further implementation of the settlement, Congress is not expressing an opinion on the manner in which such shareholders choose to balance individual rights and communal rights;

“(8) no provision of this Act [see Short Title of 1988 Amendment note above] shall—“(A) unless specifically provided, constitute a repeal or modification, implied or otherwise, of any provision of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act; or

“(B) confer on, or deny to, any Native organization any degree of sovereign governmental authority over lands (including management, or regulation of the taking, of fish and wildlife) or persons in Alaska; and


“(9) the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and this Act are Indian legislation enacted by Congress pursuant to its plenary authority under the Constitution of the United States to regulate Indian affairs.”




Judicial ReviewPub. L. 100–241, § 16, Feb. 3, 1988, 101 Stat. 1813, provided that:
“(a) Statute of Limitations.—(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a civil action that challenges the constitutionality of an amendment made by, or other provision of this Act (the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act Amendments of 1987) [see Short Title of 1988 Amendment note above] shall be barred unless filed within the periods specified in this subsection.

“(2) If a civil action described in paragraph (1) challenges—“(A) the issuance or distribution of Settlement Common Stock for less than fair market value consideration pursuant to section 7(g)(1)(B) or 7(g)(2)(C)(ii) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1606(g)(1)(B), (2)(C)(ii)]; or

“(B) an extension of alienability restrictions that involves the issuance of stock pursuant to subsections [sic] (c) or (d) of section 37 of such Act [43 U.S.C. 1629c(c), (d)]; or

“(C) the denial of dissenters rights after the rejection of an amendment to terminate alienability restrictions pursuant to section 37(b) of such Act;


such civil action shall be barred unless it is filed within one year after the date of the shareholder vote authorizing such issuance or distribution, extension of restrictions, or denial of right, and unless a request for a declaratory judgment or injunctive relief is made before stock is issued or distributed.

“(3) Any other civil action described in paragraph (1) shall be barred unless it is filed within two years of the date of the enactment of this Act [Feb. 3, 1988].

“(4) No Native Corporation taking an action described in paragraph (2)(A), (2)(B), or (2)(C) shall issue or distribute stock sooner than fourteen days after the date of the shareholder vote authorizing such action.


“(b) Jurisdiction and Procedure.—(1) The United States District Court for the District of Alaska shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over a civil action described in subsection (a)(1). The action shall be heard and determined by a court of three judges as provided in section 2284 of title 28 of the United States Code. An appeal of the final judgment of such court shall be made directly to the United States Supreme Court.

“(2) No money judgment shall be entered against the United States in a civil action subject to this section.


“(c) Statement of Purpose.—The purpose of the limitation on civil actions established by this section is—“(1) to ensure that after the expiration of a reasonable period of time, Native Shareholders, Native Corporations, the United States, and the State of Alaska and its political subdivisions will be able to plan their affairs with certainty in full reliance on the provisions of this Act, and

“(2) to eliminate the possibility that the United States will incur a monetary liability as a result of the enactment of this Act.”

“(2) to affect, for Federal tax purposes, the valuation of any stock issued by a Native Corporation.”
