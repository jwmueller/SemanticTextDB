§ 502. Postage and revenue stamps of foreign governments
Whoever forges, or counterfeits, or knowingly utters or uses any forged or counterfeit postage stamp or revenue stamp of any foreign government, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.
(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 713; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(G), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 349 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 220, 35 Stat. 1132; May 26, 1926, ch. 396, 44 Stat. 653).
A paragraph defining “foreign government” was combined with other like provisions to form section 11 of this title. A proviso against repeal, “Provided, however, That nothing in this section shall be held to repeal or modify section 350 of this title [now section 504 of this title]”, was deleted as unnecessary since that section by express reference to this one makes it clear that these sections are in pari materia.
Minor changes in phraseology were also made.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $500”.
