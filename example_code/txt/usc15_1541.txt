Study of Aversive AgentsPub. L. 101–608, title II, § 204, Nov. 16, 1990, 104 Stat. 3124, provided that: “The Consumer Product Safety Commission shall conduct a study of requiring manufacturers of consumer products to include aversive agents, as appropriate, in products which present a hazard if ingested to determine the potential effectiveness of the aversive agents in deterring ingestion. In conducting the study, the Commission shall consult with appropriate consumer, health, and business organizations and appropriate government agencies. The Commission shall report to Congress the status of the study within one year of the date of the enactment of this Act [Nov. 16, 1990] and shall complete the study not later than 2 years after such date of enactment.”


Fire Safe Cigarette Act of 1990Pub. L. 101–352, Aug. 10, 1990, 104 Stat. 405, provided that:
“SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.“(a) Short Title.—This Act may be cited as the ‘Fire Safe Cigarette Act of 1990’.

“(b) Findings.—The Congress finds that—“(1) cigarette-ignited fires are the leading cause of fire deaths in the United States,

“(2) in 1987, there were 1,492 deaths from cigarette-ignited fires, 3,809 serious injuries, and $395,000,000 in property damage caused by such fires,

“(3) the final report of the Technical Study Group on Cigarette and Little Cigar Fire Safety under the Cigarette Safety Act of 1984 [set out below] determined that (A) it is technically feasible and may be commercially feasible to develop a cigarette that will have a significantly reduced propensity to ignite furniture and mattresses, and (B) the overall impact on other aspects of the United States society and economy may be minimal,

“(4) the final report of the Technical Study Group on Cigarette and Little Cigar Fire Safety under the Cigarette Safety Act of 1984 further determined that the value of a cigarette with less of a likelihood to ignite furniture and mattresses which would prevent property damage and personal injury and loss of life is economically incalculable,

“(5) it is appropriate for the Congress to require by law the completion of the research described in the final report of the Technical Study Group on Cigarette and Little Cigar Fire Safety and an assessment of the practicability of developing a performance standard to reduce cigarette ignition propensity, and

“(6) it is appropriate for the Consumer Product Safety Commission to utilize its expertise to complete the recommendations for further work and report to Congress in a timely fashion.
