(May 7, 1952, ch. 244, § 2, 66 Stat. 65; Pub. L. 95–625, title VI, § 611, Nov. 10, 1978, 92 Stat. 3521.)


References in TextSection 441f of this title, referred to in text, was in the original “sections 1 and 5 of this Act”. Section 1 of the Act is classified to section 441f of this title. Section 5 is probably a reference to section 5 of the original bill, which would have authorized the inclusion of up to 4,000 acres of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation within the Badlands National Monument. Such section 5 was stricken from the bill by Senate amendment, and as enacted the Act contained only four sections.


Change of Name
Word “park” substituted in text for “monument” pursuant to Pub. L. 95–625, § 611, which is classified to section 441e–1 of this title and which redesignated Badlands National Monument as Badlands National Park.
