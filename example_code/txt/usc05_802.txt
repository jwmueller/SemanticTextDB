DerivationU.S. CodeRevised Statutes andStatutes at Large


(a)5 U.S.C. 33.R.S. § 165.
(b)5 U.S.C. 1074.Oct. 28, 1949, ch. 782, § 1103, 63 Stat. 972.


In subsection (a), the words “Executive department” are substituted for “department” as the definition of “department” applicable to this section is coextensive with the definition of “Executive department” in section 101. The words “or military department” are inserted to preserve the application of the source law. Before enactment of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 578), the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force were Executive departments. The National Security Act Amendments of 1949 established the Department of Defense as an Executive department including the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force as military departments, not as Executive departments. However, the source law for this subsection, which was in effect in 1949, remained applicable to the Secretaries of the military departments by virtue of section 12(g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 591), which is set out in the reviser’s note for section 301. The words “in the discretion of” are omitted as unnecessary in view of the permissive grant of authority. The words “positions in the department” are substituted for “any of the clerkships therein authorized by law”. The words “upon the same requisites and conditions” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “legal pay of the position to which appointed” are substituted for “same compensations, as are prescribed for men”.
This subsection was part of title IV of the Revised Statutes. The Act of July 26, 1947, ch. 343, § 201(d), as added Aug. 10, 1949, ch. 412, § 4, 63 Stat. 579 (former 5 U.S.C. 171–1), which provides “Except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this Act [National Security Act of 1947], the provisions of title IV of the Revised Statutes as now or hereafter amended shall be applicable to the Department of Defense” is omitted from this title, but is not repealed.
Subsection (c) is added on authority of former sections 1072 and 1072a, which are codified in section 5115.
