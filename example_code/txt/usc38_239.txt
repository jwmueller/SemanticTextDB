§ 1720A. Treatment and rehabilitative services for persons with drug or alcohol dependency(a) The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, may take appropriate steps to (1) urge all Federal agencies and appropriate private and public firms, organizations, agencies, and persons to provide appropriate employment and training opportunities for veterans who have been provided treatment and rehabilitative services under this title for alcohol or drug dependence or abuse disabilities and have been determined by competent medical authority to be sufficiently rehabilitated to be employable, and (2) provide all possible assistance to the Secretary of Labor in placing such veterans in such opportunities.

(b) Upon receipt of an application for treatment and rehabilitative services under this title for an alcohol or drug dependence or abuse disability from any individual who has been discharged or released from active military, naval, or air service but who is not eligible for such treatment and services, the Secretary shall—(1) provide referral services to assist such individual, to the maximum extent practicable, in obtaining treatment and rehabilitative services from sources outside the Department; and

(2) if pertinent, advise such individual of such individual’s rights to apply to the appropriate military, naval, or air service and the Department for review of such individual’s discharge or release from such service.


(c)(1) Any person serving in the active military, naval, or air service who is determined by the Secretary concerned to have an alcohol or drug dependence or abuse disability may be transferred to any facility in order for the Secretary to furnish care or treatment and rehabilitative services for such disability. Care and services provided to a member so transferred shall be provided as if such member were a veteran. Any transfer of any such member for such care and services shall be made pursuant to such terms as may be agreed upon by the Secretary concerned and the Secretary, subject to the provisions of sections 1535 and 1536 of title 31.

(2) No person serving in the active military, naval, or air service may be transferred pursuant to an agreement made under paragraph (1) of this subsection unless such person requests such transfer in writing for a specified period of time. No such person transferred pursuant to such a request may be furnished such care and services by the Secretary beyond the period of time specified in such request unless such person requests in writing an extension for a further specified period of time and such request is approved by the Secretary.


(d)(1) The Secretary shall ensure that each medical center of the Department develops and carries out a plan to provide treatment for substance use disorders, either through referral or direct provision of services, to veterans who require such treatment.

(2) Each plan under paragraph (1) shall make available clinically proven substance abuse treatment methods, including opioid substitution therapy, to veterans with respect to whom a qualified medical professional has determined such treatment methods to be appropriate.

Substance Use Disorders and Mental Health CarePub. L. 110–387, title I, §§ 102–105, Oct. 10, 2008, 122 Stat. 4112–4114, provided that:
“SEC. 102. FINDINGS ON SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND MENTAL HEALTH.“Congress makes the following findings:“(1) More than 1,500,000 members of the Armed Forces have been deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. The 2005 Department of Defense Survey of Health Related Behaviors Among Active Duty Personnel reports that 23 percent of members of the Armed Forces on active duty acknowledge a significant problem with alcohol use disorder, with similar rates of acknowledged problems with alcohol use disorder among members of the National Guard.

“(2) The effects of substance use disorder are wide ranging, including significantly increased risk of suicide, exacerbation of mental and physical health disorders, breakdown of family support, and increased risk of unemployment and homelessness.

“(3) While veterans suffering from mental health conditions, chronic physical illness, and polytrauma may be at increased risk for development of a substance use disorder, treatment for these veterans is complicated by the need to address adequately the physical and mental symptoms associated with these conditions through appropriate medical intervention.

“(4) While the Veterans Health Administration has dramatically increased health services for veterans from 1996 through 2006, the number of veterans receiving specialized substance use disorder treatment services decreased 18 percent during that time. No comparable decrease in the national rate of substance use disorder has been observed during that time.

“(5) While some facilities of the Veterans Health Administration provide exemplary substance use disorder treatment services, the availability of such treatment services throughout the health care system of the Veterans Health Administration is inconsistent.

“(6) According to a 2006 report by the Government Accountability Office, the Department of Veterans Affairs significantly reduced its substance use disorder treatment and rehabilitation services between 1996 and 2006, and the Fiscal Year 2007 National Mental Health Program Monitoring System report shows that little progress has been made in restoring these services to their pre-1996 levels.
