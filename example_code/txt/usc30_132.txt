Codification
Section was from act Feb. 25, 1920, in which words now reading “in Lander, Wyoming, coal entries numbered 18 to 49, inclusive,” originally read “described in the joint resolution entitled ‘Joint resolution authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to permit the continuation of coal mining operations on certain lands in Wyoming,’ approved August 12, 1912, (Thirty-seven Statutes at Large p. 1346).” The change was effected by interpolation, in lieu of the reference to the 1912 resolution, the actual description of lands contained in said resolution.
