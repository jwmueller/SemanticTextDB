(b) Bonus Amount; Time for Payment.—A bonus under subsection (a) may not exceed $12,000 per one-year certification period under subsection (c). The Secretary concerned may pay the bonus in a single lump sum at the beginning of the certification period or in installments during the certification period. The bonus is in addition to any other pay or allowance payable to a member under any other provision of law.

(c) Certification of Proficiency.—To be eligible to receive a bonus under this section, a member described in subsection (a) must be certified by the Secretary concerned as being proficient in the foreign language for which the bonus is offered. The certification of the member shall expire at the end of the one-year period beginning on the first day of the first month beginning on or after the certification date.

(B) is unable to schedule or complete the certification required by subsection (c) because of that assignment; and

(C) except for the lack of such certification, satisfies the eligibility requirements under subsection (a).

(3) A member who is paid a bonus under the authority of this subsection shall complete the certification required by subsection (c) for the foreign language for which the bonus was paid not later than the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the member is released from the assignment in connection with the contingency operation. The Secretary concerned may extend that period for a member in accordance with regulations prescribed under subsection (f).

(4) If a member fails to obtain the required certification under subsection (c) before the end of the period provided under paragraph (3), the Secretary concerned may require the member to repay all or a portion of the bonus in the manner provided in section 303a(e) of this title.


(e) Repayment.—A member who receives a bonus under this section, but who does not satisfy an eligibility requirement specified in paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) of subsection (a) for the entire certification period, shall be subject to the repayment provisions of section 303a(e) of this title.
