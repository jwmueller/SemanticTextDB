“SEC. 3. FINDINGS.“Congress finds that—“(1) because the earth provides energy, minerals, and water, and is used as a storage medium for municipal, chemical, and nuclear waste, an understanding of the processes and structures in the earth’s crust is essential to the well being of the United States;

“(2) there is a need for developing long-range plans for a United States Continental Scientific Drilling Program; and

“(3) the Continental Scientific Drilling Program would enhance—“(A) understanding of the crustal evolution of the earth and the mountain building processes;

“(B) understanding of the mechanisms of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions and the development of improved techniques for prediction;

“(C) understanding of the development and utilization of geothermal and other energy sources and the formation of and occurrence of mineral deposits;

“(D) understanding of the migration of fluids in the earth’s crust for evaluation of waste contamination and the development of more effective techniques for the safe subsurface disposal of hazardous wastes;

“(E) understanding and definition of the size, source, and more effective use of aquifers and other water resources; and

“(F) evaluation and verification of surface geophysical techniques needed for exploring and monitoring the earth’s crust.
