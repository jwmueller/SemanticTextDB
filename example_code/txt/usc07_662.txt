§ 624. Limitation on imports; authority of President(a) Whenever the Secretary of Agriculture has reason to believe that any article or articles are being or are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, any program or operation undertaken under this chapter or the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act, as amended [16 U.S.C. 590a et seq.], or section 612c of this title, or any loan, purchase, or other program or operation undertaken by the Department of Agriculture, or any agency operating under its direction, with respect to any agricultural commodity or product thereof, or to reduce substantially the amount of any product processed in the United States from any agricultural commodity or product thereof with respect to which any such program or operation is being undertaken, he shall so advise the President, and, if the President agrees that there is reason for such belief, the President shall cause an immediate investigation to be made by the United States International Trade Commission, which shall give precedence to investigations under this section to determine such facts. Such investigation shall be made after due notice and opportunity for hearing to interested parties, and shall be conducted subject to such regulations as the President shall specify.

(b) If, on the basis of such investigation and report to him of findings and recommendations made in connection therewith, the President finds the existence of such facts, he shall by proclamation impose such fees not in excess of 50 per centum ad valorem or such quantitative limitations on any article or articles which may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption as he finds and declares shown by such investigation to be necessary in order that the entry of such article or articles will not render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, any program or operation referred to in subsection (a) of this section, or reduce substantially the amount of any product processed in the United States from any such agricultural commodity or product thereof with respect to which any such program or operation is being undertaken: Provided, That no proclamation under this section shall impose any limitation on the total quantity of any article or articles which may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption which reduces such permissible total quantity to proportionately less than 50 per centum of the total quantity of such article or articles which was entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during a representative period as determined by the President: And provided further, That in designating any article or articles, the President may describe them by physical qualities, value, use, or upon such other bases as he shall determine.In any case where the Secretary of Agriculture determines and reports to the President with regard to any article or articles that a condition exists requiring emergency treatment, the President may take immediate action under this section without awaiting the recommendations of the International Trade Commission, such action to continue in effect pending the report and recommendations of the International Trade Commission and action thereon by the President.


(c) The fees and limitations imposed by the President by proclamation under this section and any revocation, suspension, or modification thereof, shall become effective on such date as shall be therein specified, and such fees shall be treated for administrative purposes and for the purposes of section 612c of this title, as duties imposed by the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. 1202 et seq.], but such fees shall not be considered as duties for the purpose of granting any preferential concession under any international obligation of the United States.

(d) After investigation, report, finding, and declaration in the manner provided in the case of a proclamation issued pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, any proclamation or provision of such proclamation may be suspended or terminated by the President whenever he finds and proclaims that the circumstances requiring the proclamation or provision thereof no longer exist or may be modified by the President whenever he finds and proclaims that changed circumstances require such modification to carry out the purposes of this section.

(e) Any decision of the President as to facts under this section shall be final.

(f) No quantitative limitation or fee shall be imposed under this section with respect to any article that is the product of a WTO member (as defined in section 3501(10) of title 19).

Proc. No. 3178. Quota on Butter Substitutes
Proc. No. 3178, Apr. 17, 1957, 22 F.R. 2701, provided:
WHEREAS, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624), the Secretary of Agriculture advised me that there was reason to believe that butter substitutes, including butter oil, containing 45 per centum or more of butterfat, which are dutiable under paragraph 709 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price-support program undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to milk and butterfat, or to reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk and butterfat with respect to which such program of the Department of Agriculture is being undertaken; and
WHEREAS on November 17, 1956, under the authority of the said section 22, I caused the United States Tariff Commission [now the United States International Trade Commission] to make an investigation with respect to this matter; and
WHEREAS, in accordance with the said section 22, as implemented by Executive Order No. 7233 of November 23, 1935, the said Tariff Commission has made such investigation and has reported to me its findings and recommendations made in connection therewith; and
WHEREAS, on the basis of the said investigation and report of the Tariff Commission, I find that butter substitutes, including butter oil, containing 45 per centum or more of butterfat and classifiable under paragraph 709 of the Tariff Act of 1930 are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to materially interfere with the said price-support program with respect to milk and butterfat, and to reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk and butterfat with respect to which said price-support program is being undertaken; and
WHEREAS I find and declare that the imposition of the quantitative limitations hereinafter proclaimed is shown by such investigation of the said Tariff Commission to be necessary in order that the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption of such butter substitutes, including butter oil, will not materially interfere with the said price-support program or reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk and butterfat with respect to which the said price-support program is being undertaken:
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the said section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act [this section], do hereby proclaim that the total aggregate quantity of butter substitutes, including butter oil, containing 45 per centum or more of butterfat and classifiable under paragraph 709 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, which shall be permitted to be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the calendar year 1958 and each subsequent calendar year shall not exceed 1,200,000 pounds. The specified quantities of the named articles which may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption are not proportionately less than 50 per centum of the total quantities of such articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the representative period from January 1, 1956, to December 31, 1956, inclusive.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this fifteenth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-first.

WHEREAS, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624), the Secretary of Agriculture advised the President that he had reason to believe that certain cotton products produced in any stage preceding the spinning into yarn are being or are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price-support program and other programs or operations undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to cotton or products thereof, or to reduce substantially the amount of cotton processed in the United States from cotton or products thereof with respect to which any such program or operation is being undertaken; and

WHEREAS, on the basis of the investigation and report of the Tariff Commission, I find that the articles with respect to which import restrictions are hereinafter proclaimed are being or are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price-support program and other programs or operations undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to cotton or products thereof; and
WHEREAS I find and declare that the important restrictions hereinafter proclaimed are shown by such investigation of the Tariff Commission to be necessary in order that the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption of the said articles will not render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price-support program and other programs or operations undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to cotton or products thereof;
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOHN F.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
