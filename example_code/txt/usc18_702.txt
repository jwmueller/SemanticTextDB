(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 790; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(L), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 1514(b) of title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Agriculture (Feb. 16, 1938, ch. 30, title V, § 514(b), 52 Stat. 76).
Words “upon conviction thereof” were omitted as surplusage since punishment can be imposed only after a conviction.
Minor changes were made in phraseology and translations.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $10,000”.
