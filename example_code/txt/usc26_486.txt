For purposes of subparagraph (B)(iii), the term “affiliated group” has the meaning assigned to such term by section 1504(a); except that (i) the phrase “more than 50 percent” shall be substituted for the phrase “at least 80 percent” each place it appears in section 1504(a), and (ii) all corporations shall be treated as includible corporations (without any exclusion under section 1504(b)).
