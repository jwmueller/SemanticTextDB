In subsection (a), the text of 15:1424(b) (related to civil penalty) is omitted because of the restatement. The words “is liable to the United States Government for” are substituted for “shall be subject to” for consistency. The words “A separate violation occurs for” are substituted for “Such violation of a provision of section 1397 of this title, or regulations issued thereunder, shall constitute a separate violation with respect to” to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsection (b)(2), the words “amount of a civil penalty imposed or compromised” are substituted for “amount of such penalty, when finally determined, or the amount agreed upon in compromise” to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsection (d), the words “who are required to attend a United States district court” are omitted as surplus. The words “be served in” are substituted for “run into” for clarity.
