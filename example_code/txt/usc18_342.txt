§ 913. Impersonator making arrest or search
Whoever falsely represents himself to be an officer, agent, or employee of the United States, and in such assumed character arrests or detains any person or in any manner searches the person, buildings, or other property of any person, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.
(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 742; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(H), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 77a (Aug. 27, 1935, ch. 740, § 201, 49 Stat. 877).
Words “shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor” were omitted. (See definitive section 1 of this title.) Words “and upon conviction thereof” preceding “shall be” were omitted as surplusage since punishment cannot be imposed until conviction is secured.
Maximum imprisonment provision was changed from 1 year to 3 years so as to be consistent with sections 911 and 912 of this title, the latter having also been changed to 3 years. There is no sound reason why a uniform punishment should not be prescribed for the offenses defined in these three sections.
Changes were made in phraseology.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $1,000”.
