(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 695, § 214, formerly § 219; renumbered § 214, Pub. L. 87–849, § 1(d), Oct. 23, 1962, 76 Stat. 1125; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(K), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 599 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking (Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, § 22(k), as added by act June 19, 1934, ch. 653, § 3, 48 Stat. 1108).
Final sentence of said section 599, imposing civil liability on violators, was omitted as unnecessary, being merely a declaration of that rule of common law which in the absence of statute fixes civil liability on the wrongdoer.
Minor changes were made in phraseology.

Prior ProvisionsA prior section 214 of this title was renumbered section 210.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000”.
