“Section 354“(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Compact, the provisions of this Title are binding from the effective date of this Compact for a period of fifteen years between the Government of the United States and the Governments of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia and thereafter as mutually agreed or in accordance with Section 231, unless earlier terminated by mutual agreement pursuant to Section 441, or amended pursuant to Article III of Title Four.

“(b) The Government of the United States recognizes, in view of the special relationship between the Government of the United States and the Governments of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia, and in view of the existence of separate agreements with each of them pursuant to Sections 321 and 323, that, even if this Title should terminate, any attack on the Marshall Islands or the Federated States of Micronesia during the period in which such separate agreements are in effect, would constitute a threat to the peace and security of the entire region and a danger to the United States. In the event of such an attack, the Government of the United States would take action to meet the danger to the United States and to the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia in accordance with its constitutional processes.
