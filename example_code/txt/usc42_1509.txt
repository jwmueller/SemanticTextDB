Congressional FindingsPub. L. 104–193, title I, § 101, Aug. 22, 1996, 110 Stat. 2110, provided that: 
“The Congress makes the following findings:
“(1) Marriage is the foundation of a successful society.

“(2) Marriage is an essential institution of a successful society which promotes the interests of children.

“(3) Promotion of responsible fatherhood and motherhood is integral to successful child rearing and the well-being of children.

“(4) In 1992, only 54 percent of single-parent families with children had a child support order established and, of that 54 percent, only about one-half received the full amount due. Of the cases enforced through the public child support enforcement system, only 18 percent of the caseload has a collection.

“(5) The number of individuals receiving aid to families with dependent children (in this section referred to as ‘AFDC’) has more than tripled since 1965. More than two-thirds of these recipients are children. Eighty-nine percent of children receiving AFDC benefits now live in homes in which no father is present.“(A)(i) The average monthly number of children receiving AFDC benefits—“(I) was 3,300,000 in 1965;

“(II) was 6,200,000 in 1970;

“(III) was 7,400,000 in 1980; and

“(IV) was 9,300,000 in 1992.


“(ii) While the number of children receiving AFDC benefits increased nearly threefold between 1965 and 1992, the total number of children in the United States aged 0 to 18 has declined by 5.5 percent.


“(B) The Department of Health and Human Services has estimated that 12,000,000 children will receive AFDC benefits within 10 years.

“(C) The increase in the number of children receiving public assistance is closely related to the increase in births to unmarried women. Between 1970 and 1991, the percentage of live births to unmarried women increased nearly threefold, from 10.7 percent to 29.5 percent.


“(6) The increase of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and births is well documented as follows:“(A) It is estimated that the rate of nonmarital teen pregnancy rose 23 percent from 54 pregnancies per 1,000 unmarried teenagers in 1976 to 66.7 pregnancies in 1991. The overall rate of nonmarital pregnancy rose 14 percent from 90.8 pregnancies per 1,000 unmarried women in 1980 to 103 in both 1991 and 1992. In contrast, the overall pregnancy rate for married couples decreased 7.3 percent between 1980 and 1991, from 126.9 pregnancies per 1,000 married women in 1980 to 117.6 pregnancies in 1991.

“(B) The total of all out-of-wedlock births between 1970 and 1991 has risen from 10.7 percent to 29.5 percent and if the current trend continues, 50 percent of all births by the year 2015 will be out-of-wedlock.


“(7) An effective strategy to combat teenage pregnancy must address the issue of male responsibility, including statutory rape culpability and prevention. The increase of teenage pregnancies among the youngest girls is particularly severe and is linked to predatory sexual practices by men who are significantly older.“(A) It is estimated that in the late 1980’s, the rate for girls age 14 and under giving birth increased 26 percent.

“(B) Data indicates that at least half of the children born to teenage mothers are fathered by adult men. Available data suggests that almost 70 percent of births to teenage girls are fathered by men over age 20.

“(C) Surveys of teen mothers have revealed that a majority of such mothers have histories of sexual and physical abuse, primarily with older adult men.


“(8) The negative consequences of an out-of-wedlock birth on the mother, the child, the family, and society are well documented as follows:“(A) Young women 17 and under who give birth outside of marriage are more likely to go on public assistance and to spend more years on welfare once enrolled. These combined effects of ‘younger and longer’ increase total AFDC costs per household by 25 percent to 30 percent for 17-year-olds.

“(B) Children born out-of-wedlock have a substantially higher risk of being born at a very low or moderately low birth weight.

“(C) Children born out-of-wedlock are more likely to experience low verbal cognitive attainment, as well as more child abuse, and neglect.

“(D) Children born out-of-wedlock were more likely to have lower cognitive scores, lower educational aspirations, and a greater likelihood of becoming teenage parents themselves.

“(E) Being born out-of-wedlock significantly reduces the chances of the child growing up to have an intact marriage.

“(F) Children born out-of-wedlock are 3 times more likely to be on welfare when they grow up.


“(9) Currently 35 percent of children in single-parent homes were born out-of-wedlock, nearly the same percentage as that of children in single-parent homes whose parents are divorced (37 percent). While many parents find themselves, through divorce or tragic circumstances beyond their control, facing the difficult task of raising children alone, nevertheless, the negative consequences of raising children in single-parent homes are well documented as follows:“(A) Only 9 percent of married-couple families with children under 18 years of age have income below the national poverty level. In contrast, 46 percent of female-headed households with children under 18 years of age are below the national poverty level.

“(B) Among single-parent families, nearly ½ of the mothers who never married received AFDC while only ⅕ of divorced mothers received AFDC.

“(C) Children born into families receiving welfare assistance are 3 times more likely to be on welfare when they reach adulthood than children not born into families receiving welfare.

“(D) Mothers under 20 years of age are at the greatest risk of bearing low birth weight babies.

“(E) The younger the single-parent mother, the less likely she is to finish high school.

“(F) Young women who have children before finishing high school are more likely to receive welfare assistance for a longer period of time.

“(G) Between 1985 and 1990, the public cost of births to teenage mothers under the aid to families with dependent children program, the food stamp program, and the medicaid program has been estimated at $120,000,000,000.

“(H) The absence of a father in the life of a child has a negative effect on school performance and peer adjustment.

“(I) Children of teenage single parents have lower cognitive scores, lower educational aspirations, and a greater likelihood of becoming teenage parents themselves.

“(J) Children of single-parent homes are 3 times more likely to fail and repeat a year in grade school than are children from intact 2-parent families.

“(K) Children from single-parent homes are almost 4 times more likely to be expelled or suspended from school.

“(L) Neighborhoods with larger percentages of youth aged 12 through 20 and areas with higher percentages of single-parent households have higher rates of violent crime.

“(M) Of those youth held for criminal offenses within the State juvenile justice system, only 29.8 percent lived primarily in a home with both parents. In contrast to these incarcerated youth, 73.9 percent of the 62,800,000 children in the Nation’s resident population were living with both parents.


“(10) Therefore, in light of this demonstration of the crisis in our Nation, it is the sense of the Congress that prevention of out-of-wedlock pregnancy and reduction in out-of-wedlock birth are very important Government interests and the policy contained in part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.] (as amended by section 103(a) of this Act) is intended to address the crisis.”

Appropriation by State LegislaturesPub. L. 104–193, title IX, § 901, Aug. 22, 1996, 110 Stat. 2347, provided that:
“(a) In General.—Any funds received by a State under the provisions of law specified in subsection (b) shall be subject to appropriation by the State legislature, consistent with the terms and conditions required under such provisions of law.

“(b) Provisions of Law.—The provisions of law specified in this subsection are the following:“(1) Part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.] (relating to block grants for temporary assistance for needy families).
