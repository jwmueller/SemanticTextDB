VII to the Secretary of Transportation to be carried out through the National Transportation Safety Board. The reference to the National Transportation Safety Board is to the independent Board established by section 303(a) of the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93–633, 88 Stat. 2167) outside the Department of Transportation and not to the prior Board that was a part of the Department.

The words “in the Treasury” are added for clarity and consistency. The words “The Secretary may use amounts in the account” are substituted for “These moneys may be used, in the discretion of the Secretary” for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “to getting and providing the information” are substituted for “to the work and/or to secure in connection therewith the special services of persons who are neither officers nor employees of the United States” for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsection (d), the words “in carrying out duties and powers under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C. 1301 et seq.)” are substituted for “in discharge of responsibilities under this chapter” in 49:1343(b) because of the transfer of aviation functions to the Secretary under 49:1655(c)(1) and for consistency. The words “directly related to carrying out that part” are substituted for “directly relating to such responsibilities” in 49:1343(b) because of the restatement of the source provisions.
