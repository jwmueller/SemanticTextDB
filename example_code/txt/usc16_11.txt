§ 1a–3. Legislative jurisdiction; relinquishment by Secretary; submittal of proposed agreement to Congressional committees; concurrent legislative jurisdiction
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of the Interior may relinquish to a State, or to a Commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States, part of the legislative jurisdiction of the United States over National Park System lands or interests therein in that State, Commonwealth, territory, or possession: Provided, That prior to consummating any such relinquishment, the Secretary shall submit the proposed agreement to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives, and shall not finalize such agreement until sixty calendar days after such submission shall have elapsed. Relinquishment of legislative jurisdiction under this section may be accomplished (1) by filing with the Governor (or, if none exists, with the chief executive officer) of the State, Commonwealth, territory, or possession concerned a notice of relinquishment to take effect upon acceptance thereof, or (2) as the laws of the State, Commonwealth, territory, or possession may otherwise provide. The Secretary shall diligently pursue the consummation of arrangements with each State, Commonwealth, territory, or possession within which a unit of the National Park System is located to the end that insofar as practicable the United States shall exercise concurrent legislative jurisdiction within units of the National Park System.
