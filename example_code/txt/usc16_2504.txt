“(b) The Secretary of Agriculture is directed, in developing five-year operating plans under the provisions of existing fifty-year timber sales contracts in Alaska, to revise such contracts to make them consistent with the guidelines and standards provided for in the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, as amended [16 U.S.C. 1600 et seq.], and to reflect such revisions in the contract price of timber.
