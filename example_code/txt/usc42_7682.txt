§ 16296. Low-volume oil and gas reservoir research program(a) Definition of GISIn this section, the term “GIS” means geographic information systems technology that facilitates the organization and management of data with a geographic component.


(b) ProgramThe Secretary shall establish a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application to maximize the productive capacity of marginal wells and reservoirs.


(c) Data collectionUnder the program, the Secretary shall collect data on—(1) the status and location of marginal wells and oil and gas reservoirs;

(2) the production capacity of marginal wells and oil and gas reservoirs;

(3) the location of low-pressure gathering facilities and pipelines; and

(4) the quantity of natural gas vented or flared in association with crude oil production.


(d) AnalysisUnder the program, the Secretary shall—(1) estimate the remaining producible reserves based on variable pipeline pressures; and

(2) recommend measures that will enable the continued production of those resources.


(e) Study(1) In generalThe Secretary may award a grant to an organization of States that contain significant numbers of marginal oil and natural gas wells to conduct an annual study of low-volume natural gas reservoirs.


(2) Organization with no GIS capabilitiesIf an organization receiving a grant under paragraph (1) does not have GIS capabilities, the organization shall contract with an institution of higher education with GIS capabilities.


(3) State geologistsThe organization receiving a grant under paragraph (1) shall collaborate with the State geologist of each State being studied.



(f) Public informationThe Secretary may use the data collected and analyzed under this section to produce maps and literature to disseminate to States to promote conservation of natural gas reserves.
