“The Attorney General and the Secretary of State shall develop protocols and guidelines for updating lookout books and the automated visa lookout system and similar mechanisms for the screening of aliens applying for visas for admission, or for admission, to the United States. Such protocols and guidelines shall be developed in a manner that ensures that in the case of an alien—“(1) whose name is in such system, and

“(2) who either (A) applies for admission after the effective date of the amendments made by this section [see Effective Date of 1990 Amendment note above], or (B) requests (in writing to a local consular office after such date) a review, without seeking admission, of the alien’s continued inadmissibility under the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.],


if the alien is no longer inadmissible because of an amendment made by this section the alien’s name shall be removed from such books and system and the alien shall be informed of such removal and if the alien continues to be inadmissible the alien shall be informed of such determination.”
