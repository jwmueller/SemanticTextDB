(2) Special rule for foreign organizationsIn the case of an organization described in section 511 which is a foreign organization, the unrelated business taxable income shall be—(A) its unrelated business taxable income which is derived from sources within the United States and which is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, plus

(B) its unrelated business taxable income which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.


(3) Special rules applicable to organizations described in paragraph (7), (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c)(A) General ruleIn the case of an organization described in paragraph (7), (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c), the term “unrelated business taxable income” means the gross income (excluding any exempt function income), less the deductions allowed by this chapter which are directly connected with the production of the gross income (excluding exempt function income), both computed with the modifications provided in paragraphs (6), (10), (11), and (12) of subsection (b).
