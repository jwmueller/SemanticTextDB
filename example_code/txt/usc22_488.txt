§ 286w. Denial of membership or other status in Fund for Palestine Liberation Organization; United States participation in Fund if membership or other status granted; report by President to Congress
It is the policy of the United States that the Palestine Liberation Organization should not be given membership in the Fund or be given observer status or any other official status at any meeting sponsored by or associated with the Fund. The United States Executive Director of the Fund shall promptly notify the Fund of such policy.
In the event that the Fund provides either membership, observer status, or any other official status to the Palestine Liberation Organization, such action would result in a serious diminution of United States support. Upon review of such action, the President would be required to report his recommendations to the Congress with regard to any further United States participation in the Fund.
