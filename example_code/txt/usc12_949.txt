Any member of the supervisory committee may be suspended by a majority vote of the board of directors. The members shall decide, at a meeting held not less than seven nor more than fourteen days after any such suspension, whether the suspended committee member shall be removed from or restored to the supervisory committee.

As used in this section, the term “passbook” shall include any book, statement of account, or other record approved by the Board for use by Federal credit unions.
