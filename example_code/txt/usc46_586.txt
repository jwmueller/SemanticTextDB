The definitions of “oceanographic research vessel” and “scientific personnel” in 46 App. U.S.C. 441 are omitted because substantially the same definitions are already in 46 U.S.C. 2101.
The text of 46 App. U.S.C. 444 is omitted because section 10101(3) of title 46, which defines “seaman” for purposes of part G of subtitle II of title 46, already contains an exception for scientific personnel. Title 53 of the Revised Statutes, referred to [in] 46 App. U.S.C. 444, was previously codified principally in part G of subtitle II of title 46.
