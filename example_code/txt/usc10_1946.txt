In the section, the words “disbursing official” are substituted for “disbursing officer” for consistency with other titles of the United States Code.

In clause (C), the words “to be performed by such disbursing officers” are omitted as unnecessary.
In subsection (a)(2), the words “deputy disbursing official” are substituted for “agent officer” for clarity and consistency.
In subsection (b)(1), the word “disabled” is substituted for “incapacity” for consistency in the title. The word “until” is substituted for “for a period of time not to extend beyond” to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsection (b)(2), the words “The deputy disbursing official, and not the former disbursing official or the estate of the former disbursing official” are substituted for “The former disbursing officer or his estate . . . but the deputy disbursing officer shall be responsible therefor” for clarity and because of the restatement. The word “liable” is substituted for “subject to any legal liability or penalty” to eliminate unnecessary words. The word “actions” is substituted for “official acts and defaults”.
