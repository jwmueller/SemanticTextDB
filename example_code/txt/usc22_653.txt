§ 290n–4. Regional offices
The Commission may designate or establish one border health office in each of the States of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. Such office should be located within the United States-Mexico Border Area, and should be coordinated with—(1) State border health offices; and

(2) local nonprofit organizations designated by the State’s chief executive officer and directly involved in border health issues.


If feasible to avoid duplicative efforts, the Commission offices should be located in existing State or local nonprofit offices. The Commission should provide adequate compensation for cooperative efforts and resources.
