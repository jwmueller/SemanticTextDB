Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 102–96, § 3(2), substituted “, schools of medicine and primary providers” for “and schools of medicine” in heading and substituted “schools of medicine, osteopathic medicine, and existing consortia of primary care providers organized to conduct clinical research concerning acquired immune deficiency syndrome” for “schools of medicine and osteopathic medicine”.
Subsec. (e). Pub. L. 102–96, § 3(3), substituted “1996” for “1991” in pars. (1) and (2).

Findings and Sense of CongressPub. L. 102–96, § 2, Aug. 14, 1991, 105 Stat. 481, provided that:
“(a) Findings.—Congress finds that—“(1) community-based clinical trials complement the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ university-based research in order to provide increased access to experimental therapies;

“(2) community-based clinical trials provide an efficient and cost-effective means to develop new HIV-related treatments, benefiting all people living with HIV disease and other illnesses; and

“(3) because the community-based clinical trials model has a proven ability to conduct rapid trials that meet the very highest standards of scientific inquiry, this program should be reauthorized and significantly expanded.


“(b) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that, because of Terry Beirn’s tireless efforts to foster a partnership among all parties invested in AIDS research (including the National Institutes of Health university-based research system, primary care physicians practicing in the community, and patients), the community-based clinical trials program should be renamed as the ‘Terry Beirn Community-Based AIDS Research Initiative’ in his honor.”
