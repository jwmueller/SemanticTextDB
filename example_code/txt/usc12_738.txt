(iv) include such nondwelling facilities as the Secretary deems desirable and consistent with the urban renewal plan or, where appropriate, with the locally developed strategy for neighborhood improvement, conservation or preservation: Provided, That the project shall be predominantly residential and any nondwelling facility included in the mortgage shall be found by the Secretary to contribute to the economic feasibility of the project, and the Secretary shall give due consideration to the possible effect of the project on other business enterprises in the community.



(4) The mortgage shall provide for complete amortization by periodic payments (unless otherwise approved by the Secretary) within such terms as the Secretary may prescribe, but as to mortgages coming within the provisions of paragraph (3)(A) of this subsection not to exceed the maximum maturity prescribed by the provisions of section 1709(b)(3) of this title.

(5) The Secretary is authorized to fix a premium charge for the insurance of home improvement loans under this subsection but in the case of any such loan such charge shall not be less than an amount equivalent to one-half of 1 per centum per annum nor more than an amount equivalent to 1 per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation of the loan outstanding at any time, without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments. Such premium charges shall be payable by the financial institution either in cash or in debentures (at par plus accrued interest) issued by the Secretary as obligations of the General Insurance Fund, in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary, and the Secretary may require the payment of one or more such premium charges at the time the loan is insured, at such discount rate as he may prescribe not in excess of the interest rate specified in the loan. If the Secretary finds upon presentation of a loan for insurance and the tender of the initial premium charge or charges so required that the loan complies with the provisions of this subsection, such loan may be accepted for insurance by endorsement or otherwise as the Secretary may prescribe. In the event the principal obligation of any loan accepted for insurance under this subsection is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is authorized to refund to the financial institution for the account of the borrower all, or such portions as he shall determine to be equitable, of the current unearned premium charges theretofore paid.

They shall be exempt from taxation as provided in section 1713(i) of this title with respect to debentures issued under that section. They shall be paid out of the General Insurance Fund which shall be primarily liable therefor and they shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, and, in the case of debentures issued in certificated registered form, the guaranty shall be expressed on the face of the debentures. In the event the General Insurance Fund fails to pay upon demand, when due, the principal of or interest on any debentures so guaranteed, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the holders the amount thereof which is authorized to be appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and thereupon, to the extent of the amounts so paid, the Secretary of the Treasury shall succeed to all the rights of the holders of such debentures. Debentures issued under this subsection shall be in such form and amounts; shall be subject to such terms and conditions; and shall include such provisions for redemption, if any, as may be prescribed by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury; and may be in book entry or certificated registered form, or such other form as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may prescribe in regulations.
