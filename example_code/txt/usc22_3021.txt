The contracting officer may also direct the contractor to take specific steps to abate an alleged violation or enforce the requirements of a compliance plan implemented pursuant to section 7104a of this title.


(2) InvestigationAn Inspector General who receives a referral under paragraph (1) or otherwise receives credible information that a recipient of the grant, contract, or cooperative agreement; any subgrantee or subcontractor of the recipient; or any agent of the recipient or of such a subgrantee or subcontractor, has engaged in an activity described in section 7104(g) of this title, as amended by section 1702, shall promptly review the referral or information and determine whether to initiate an investigation of the matter. In the event that an Inspector General does not initiate an investigation, the Inspector General shall document the rationale for the decision not to investigate.


(3) Criminal investigationIf the matter is referred to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, the Inspector General may suspend any investigation under this subsection pending the outcome of the criminal prosecution. The Inspector General shall notify the head of the executive agency that awarded the contract, grant, or cooperative agreement of an indictment, information, or criminal complaint against the recipient of a contract, grant, or cooperative agreement; any subgrantee or subcontractor of the recipient; or any agent of the recipient or of a subgrantee or subcontractor. If the criminal investigation results in a decision not to prosecute, the Inspector General shall promptly determine whether to resume any investigation that was suspended pursuant to this paragraph. In the event that an Inspector General does not resume an investigation, the Inspector General shall document the rationale for the decision.



(b) ReportUpon completion of an investigation under subsection (a), the Inspector General shall submit a report on the investigation to the head of the executive agency that awarded the contract, grant, or cooperative agreement. The report shall include the Inspector General’s conclusions regarding whether or not any allegations that the recipient of a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement; any subcontractor or subgrantee of the recipient; or any agent of the recipient or of such a subcontractor or subgrantee, engaged in any of the activities described in section 7104(g) of this title, as amended by section 1702, are substantiated.


(c) Remedial actions(1) In generalUpon receipt of an Inspector General’s report substantiating an allegation that the recipient of a contract, grant, or cooperative agreement; any subgrantee or subcontractor of the recipient; or any agent of the recipient or of a subgrantee or subcontractor, engaged in any of the activities described in section 7104(g) of this title, as amended by section 1702, or notification of an indictment, information, or criminal complaint for an offense under subsection (a)(3), the head of agency shall consider taking one or more of the following remedial actions:(A) Requiring the recipient to remove an employee from the performance of work under the grant, contract, or cooperative agreement.

(B) Requiring the recipient to terminate a subcontract or subgrant.

(C) Suspending payments under the grant, contract, or cooperative agreement until such time as the recipient of the grant, contract, or cooperative agreement has taken appropriate remedial action.

(G) Referring the matter to the agency suspension and debarment official.


(2) Savings clauseNothing in this subsection shall be construed as limiting the scope of applicable remedies available to the Federal Government.


(3) Mitigating factorWhere applicable, the head of an executive agency may consider whether the contractor or grantee had a plan in place under section 7104a of this title, and was in compliance with that plan at the time of the violation, as a mitigating factor in determining which remedies, if any, should apply.


(4) Aggravating factorWhere applicable, the head of an executive agency may consider the failure of a contractor or grantee to abate an alleged violation or enforce the requirements of a compliance plan when directed by a contracting officer pursuant to subsection (a)(1) as an aggravating factor in determining which remedies, if any, should apply.



(d) Inclusion of report conclusions in FAPIIS(1) In generalThe head of an executive agency shall ensure that any substantiated allegation in the report under subsection (b) is included in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) and that the contractor has an opportunity to respond to any such report in accordance with applicable statutes and regulations.
