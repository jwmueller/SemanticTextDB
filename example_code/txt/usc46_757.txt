In subsection (a)(3), the words “construction and purchase” before “agreement” are omitted because the source provision for section 55332(b) of the revised title does not say anything about construction.
In subsection (b), the words “vessels of the United States” are substituted for “United States-flag vessel” for consistency in the revised title.
