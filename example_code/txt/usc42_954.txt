Congressional Statement of FindingsPub. L. 101–590, § 2, Nov. 16, 1990, 104 Stat. 2915, provided that: 
“The Congress finds that—
“(1) the Federal Government and the governments of the States have established a history of cooperation in the development, implementation, and monitoring of integrated, comprehensive systems for the provision of emergency medical services throughout the United States;

“(2) physical trauma is the leading cause of death of Americans between the ages of 1 and 44 and is the third leading cause of death in the general population of the United States;

“(3) physical trauma in the United States results in an aggregate annual cost of $180,000,000,000 in medical expenses, insurance, lost wages, and property damage;

“(4) barriers to the provision of prompt and appropriate emergency medical services exist in many areas of the United States;

“(5) few States and communities have developed and implemented trauma care systems;

“(6) many trauma centers have incurred substantial uncompensated costs in providing trauma care, and such costs have caused many such centers to cease participation in trauma care systems; and

“(7) the number of incidents of physical trauma in the United States is a serious medical and social problem, and the number of deaths resulting from such incidents can be substantially reduced by improving the trauma-care components of the systems for the provision of emergency medical services in the United States.”
