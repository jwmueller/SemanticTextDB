“SEC. 609. FUTURE LAND EXCHANGE OPPORTUNITY.“(a) Finding.—The Congress finds that certain lands which were identified for exchange to the United States in the I–90 Land Exchange process have been, or may be, deleted from the final exchange under this Act due to value equalization or other reasons. However, some or all of such deleted lands, or other Plum Creek lands, may possess attributes that merit their conveyance to the United States in a follow-up land exchange, including lands in or around the Carbon River, the Yakima River, the Pacific Crest Trail, Watch Mountain and Goat Mountain on the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, the Green River and the Manastash late successional reserve.

“(b) Future Exchange.—In furtherance of subsection (a), the Secretary is authorized and directed to consult with Plum Creek in examining opportunities for the United States to acquire such deleted lands, or other Plum Creek lands in the State of Washington, in a future exchange.

“(c) Report to Congress.—Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act [Oct. 21, 1998], the Secretary shall submit a report to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate and the Committee on Resources [now Committee on Natural Resources] of the United States House of Representatives briefly outlining future land exchange opportunities with Plum Creek, including those for which the Secretary is required to consult under section 608, which the Secretary determines merit detailed analysis and consideration. The Secretary should identify the most urgent acquisitions for purchase or exchange in the report.
