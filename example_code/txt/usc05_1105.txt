(B) a newly approved health benefits plan is offered, or

(C) an existing plan is terminated,


provide a period of not less than 3 weeks during which any employee, annuitant, former spouse, or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of this title enrolled in a health benefits plan described by such section shall be permitted to transfer that individual’s enrollment to another such plan or to cancel such enrollment.

(2) In addition to any opportunity afforded under paragraph (1) of this subsection, an employee, annuitant, former spouse, or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of this title enrolled in a health benefits plan under this chapter shall be permitted to transfer that individual’s enrollment to another such plan, or to cancel such enrollment, at such other times and subject to such conditions as the Office may prescribe in regulations.

(3)(A) In addition to any informational requirements otherwise applicable under this chapter, the regulations shall include provisions to ensure that each employee eligible to enroll in a health benefits plan under this chapter (whether actually enrolled or not) is notified in writing as to the rights afforded under section 8905a of this title.

(B) Notification under this paragraph shall be provided by employing agencies at an appropriate point in time before each period under paragraph (1) so that employees may be aware of their rights under section 8905a of this title when making enrollment decisions during such period.



(h)(1) An unenrolled employee who is required by a court or administrative order to provide health insurance coverage for 1 or more children who meets the requirements of section 8901(5) may enroll for self plus one or self and family coverage, as necessary to provide health insurance coverage for each child who is covered under the order, in a health benefits plan under this chapter. If such employee fails to enroll for self plus one or self and family coverage, as necessary to provide health insurance coverage for each child who is covered under the order, in a health benefits plan that provides full benefits and services in the location in which the child or children reside, and the employee does not provide documentation showing that such coverage has been provided through other health insurance, the employing agency shall enroll the employee in a self plus one or self and family enrollment, as necessary to provide health insurance coverage for each child who is covered under the order, in the option which provides the lower level of coverage under the Service Benefit Plan.

(2) An employee who is enrolled as an individual in a health benefits plan under this chapter and who is required by a court or administrative order to provide health insurance coverage for 1 or more children who meets the requirements of section 8901(5) may change to a self plus one or self and family enrollment, as necessary to provide health insurance coverage for each child who is covered under the order, in the same or another health benefits plan under this chapter. If such employee fails to change to a self plus one or self and family enrollment, as necessary to provide health insurance coverage for each child who is covered under the order, and the employee does not provide documentation showing that such coverage has been provided through other health insurance, the employing agency shall change the enrollment of the employee to a self plus one or self and family enrollment, as necessary to provide health insurance coverage for each child who is covered under the order, in the plan in which the employee is enrolled if that plan provides full benefits and services in the location where the child or children reside. If the plan in which the employee is enrolled does not provide full benefits and services in the location in which the child or children reside, or, if the employee fails to change to a self plus one or self and family enrollment, as necessary to provide health insurance coverage for each child who is covered under the order, in a plan that provides full benefits and services in the location where the child or children reside, the employing agency shall change the coverage of the employee to a self plus one or self and family enrollment, as necessary to provide health insurance coverage for each child who is covered under the order, in the option which provides the lower level of coverage under the Service Benefits Plan.

(3) The employee may not discontinue the self plus one or self and family enrollment, as necessary to provide health insurance coverage for each child who is covered under the order, in a plan that provides full benefits and services in the location in which the child or children reside for so long as the court or administrative order remains in effect and the child or children continue to meet the requirements of section 8901(5), unless the employee provides documentation showing that such coverage has been provided through other health insurance.
