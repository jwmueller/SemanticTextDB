§ 2324. Allowable costs under defense contracts(a) Indirect Cost That Violates a FAR Cost Principle.—The head of an agency shall require that a covered contract provide that if the contractor submits to the agency a proposal for settlement of indirect costs incurred by the contractor for any period after such costs have been accrued and if that proposal includes the submission of a cost which is unallowable because the cost violates a cost principle in the Federal Acquisition Regulation or applicable agency supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the cost shall be disallowed.

(b) Penalty for Violation of Cost Principle.—(1) If the head of the agency determines that a cost submitted by a contractor in its proposal for settlement is expressly unallowable under a cost principle referred to in subsection (a) that defines the allowability of specific selected costs, the head of the agency shall assess a penalty against the contractor in an amount equal to—(A) the amount of the disallowed cost allocated to covered contracts for which a proposal for settlement of indirect costs has been submitted; plus

(B) interest (to be computed based on provisions in the Federal Acquisition Regulation) to compensate the United States for the use of any funds which a contractor has been paid in excess of the amount to which the contractor was entitled.


(2) If the head of the agency determines that a proposal for settlement of indirect costs submitted by a contractor includes a cost determined to be unallowable in the case of such contractor before the submission of such proposal, the head of the agency shall assess a penalty against the contractor in an amount equal to two times the amount of the disallowed cost allocated to covered contracts for which a proposal for settlement of indirect costs has been submitted.


(c) Waiver of Penalty.—The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall provide for a penalty under subsection (b) to be waived in the case of a contractor’s proposal for settlement of indirect costs when—(1) the contractor withdraws the proposal before the formal initiation of an audit of the proposal by the Federal Government and resubmits a revised proposal;

(2) the amount of unallowable costs subject to the penalty is insignificant; or

(3) the contractor demonstrates, to the contracting officer’s satisfaction, that—(A) it has established appropriate policies and personnel training and an internal control and review system that provide assurances that unallowable costs subject to penalties are precluded from being included in the contractor’s proposal for settlement of indirect costs; and

(B) the unallowable costs subject to the penalty were inadvertently incorporated into the proposal.



(d) Applicability of Contract Disputes Procedure to Disallowance of Cost and Assessment of Penalty.—An action of the head of an agency under subsection (a) or (b)—(1) shall be considered a final decision for the purposes of section 7103 of title 41; and

(2) is appealable in the manner provided in section 7104(a) of title 41.

Historical and Revision NotesSubsection (e)(1)(L) is based on section 2399 of this title as enacted by Pub. L. 97–295, § 1(29)(A), Oct. 12, 1982, 96 Stat. 1293.
Section 1(f)(2) of the bill would transfer the provisions of existing 10 U.S.C. 2399 to a new subparagraph (L) of 10 U.S.C. 2324(e)(1). The existing section 2399 prohibits the use of appropriated funds to reimburse a defense contractor for insurance against the contractor’s costs of correcting defects in the contractor’s materials or workmanship. The transfer would add the provision to the list of contractor costs which are not allowable as expenses which may be paid by the Department of Defense under a contract. This allowable cost limitation applies only to contracts for more than $100,000 other than fixed price contracts without cost incentives (see 10 U.S.C. 2324(k)). The committee determined that it is appropriate to treat the subject matter of section 2399 in the same manner as other provisions relating to allowable costs of defense contractors and notes that section 2324, providing a more comprehensive treatment of allowable costs, was enacted after section 2399. The committee recognizes that contracts for amounts less than $100,000 and fixed price contracts without cost incentives are covered by the existing section 2399 and would not be covered by the provision as transferred. The committee determined that in practice the existing section 2399 would not have significant applicability to such contracts and that the transfer is appropriate as part of this bill.
Subsection (j) is based on Pub. L. 99–145, title IX, § 933, Nov. 8, 1985, 99 Stat. 700.

Section 4, which was classified to section 10b–1 of former Title 41, Public Contracts, was omitted from the Code in view of section 7004 of Pub. L. 100–418 which provided that the amendment by Pub. L. 100–418 which enacted section 4 ceased to be effective on Apr. 30, 1996. Section 4 was subsequently repealed by Pub.
