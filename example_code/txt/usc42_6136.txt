“(a) Preparation and Submission of Report.—The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency, shall prepare and submit to the Congress a report on whether current programs and plans for management of nuclear waste as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.) are adequate for management of any additional volumes or categories of nuclear waste that might be generated by any new nuclear power plants that might be constructed and licensed after the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 24, 1992]. The Secretary shall prepare the report for submission to the President and the Congress within 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act. The report shall examine any new relevant issues related to management of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste that might be raised by the addition of new nuclear-generated electric capacity, including anticipated increased volumes of spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste, any need for additional interim storage capacity prior to final disposal, transportation of additional volumes of waste, and any need for additional repositories for deep geologic disposal.

“(b) Opportunity for Public Comment.—In preparation of the report required under subsection (a), the Secretary of Energy shall offer members of the public an opportunity to provide information and comment and shall solicit the views of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other interested parties.

“(c) Authorization of Appropriations.—There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this section.”
