When settling the account of a paymaster of a lost or captured naval vessel, the Comptroller General in settling money accounts, and the Secretary of the Navy in settling property accounts, shall credit the account of the paymaster for the amount of provisions, clothing, small stores, and money for which the paymaster is charged that the Comptroller General or Secretary believes was lost inevitably because of the loss or capture.

The word “naval” is substituted for “belonging to the Navy of the United States” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “Secretary of the Navy” are substituted for “Paymaster General of the Navy” because of section 1 of the Act of March 29, 1894 (ch. 49, 28 Stat. 47), and 10:5061. The words “the account of the paymaster” are substituted for “him” for clarity. The words “such portion of the”, “on their books”, and “of a public vessel” are omitted as surplus. The words “free of” are substituted for “fully exonerated by such credit from all” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “so proved to have been captured or lost” are omitted as surplus.
