The word “records” is substituted for “books and records” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.
In subsection (a), the reference to the “council of administration” is retained although 36:946 and 947 (restated in section 30505 of the revised title) do not create a governing body called a “council of administration.”
