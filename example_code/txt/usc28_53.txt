Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 178 and 178a (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 97, 36 Stat. 1119; Jan. 21, 1920, ch. 50, 41 Stat. 394; July 1, 1922, ch. 260, 42 Stat. 812; Aug. 12, 1937, ch. 591, 50 Stat. 623).
A reference in section 178 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to Franklin County in the list of Counties in the Northern District, in which one term might be held annually, in the discretion of the judge, was omitted as superseded by the provisions of said section 178a of title 28, requiring an annual term to be held at Malone, which is in Franklin County.
References to seizures made, matters done and processes or orders issued respecting waters within the concurrent jurisdiction of the southern and eastern districts, were omitted as unnecessary and covered by the revised language.
Provision for 20 days’ notice of the special term authorized in the discretion of the court in the counties of Clinton, Jefferson, Onondaga, Oswego, Rensselaer, St. Lawrence, Saratoga, and Schenectady was omitted as unnecessary, in view of section 141 of this title providing for such notice as the district judge orders.
The special provision permitting any district judge in New York to act as judge in any other district in that State upon request of the resident district judge was omitted, thus making applicable the uniform procedure for designation and assignment of district judges throughout the United States, provided by section 292 of this title.
Words “with the waters thereof” after the list of counties in each district were omitted as unnecessary and inconsistent with other sections of this chapter.
The provisions with reference to the return of process in admiralty cases, the designation of judges and their powers, and the holding of sessions for the hearing of motions and for proceedings in bankruptcy and admiralty, were omitted as unnecessary and more properly the subject of rule of court.
The provisions of sections 178 and 178a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., respecting court accommodations at Malone and in the counties of Schenectady, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Onondaga, St. Lawrence, Clinton, Jefferson, Oswego, and Franklin, were omitted as covered by section 142 of this title.
The county of Bronx, in the southern district, was formed out of a part of New York County in 1912.
Lockport was omitted as a place of holding court in the Western District. Court has not been held there for 32 years.
