Historical and Revision Notes


DerivationU.S. CodeRevised Statutes andStatutes at Large


 5 U.S.C. 48.R.S. § 187.
 5 U.S.C. 313.R.S. § 364.


Sections 187 and 364 of the Revised Statutes are combined into one section since they both deal with the same subject matter and are derived from the Act of Feb. 14, 1871, ch. 51, § 3, 16 Stat. 412.
The words “executive department” are substituted for “Department” because “Department”, as used in R.S. §§ 187 and 364, meant “executive department”. (See R.S. § 159.) The word “agency” is substituted for “bureau” as it has a more common current acceptance. The word “concerning” is substituted for “touching”. Reference to application for a subpena is omitted as R.S. § 364 gives the department head the same authority to request aid from the Attorney General whether or not application has been made for a subpena.
Section 187 of the Revised Statutes was part of title IV of the Revised Statutes. The Act of July 26, 1947, ch. 343, § 201(d), as added Aug. 10, 1949, ch. 412, § 4, 63 Stat. 579 (former 5 U.S.C. 171–1), which provides “Except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this Act [National Security Act of 1947], the provisions of title IV of the Revised Statutes as now or hereafter amended shall be applicable to the Department of Defense” is omitted from this title but is not repealed.
Minor changes are made in phraseology to allow for the combining of the two sections.
