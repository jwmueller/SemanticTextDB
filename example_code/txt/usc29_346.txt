(B) Maintenance of 1992 amountsSubject to the availability of appropriations to carry out this subpart, the amount of any allotment made under subparagraph (A) to a State for a fiscal year shall not be less than the amount of an allotment made to the State for fiscal year 1992 under part A of this subchapter, as in effect on the day before October 29, 1992.


(C) MinimumsSubject to the availability of appropriations to carry out this subpart, and except as provided in subparagraph (B), the allotment to any State under subparagraph (A) shall be not less than $275,000 or ⅓ of 1 percent of the sums made available for the fiscal year for which the allotment is made, whichever is greater, and the allotment of any State under this section for any fiscal year that is less than $275,000 or ⅓ of 1 percent of such sums shall be increased to the greater of the two amounts.

Any amount made available to a State for any fiscal year pursuant to the preceding sentence shall, for the purposes of this section, be regarded as an increase in the allotment of the State (as determined under the preceding provisions of this section) for such year.
