(13) an explanation of any cost the borrower may incur in the making or collection of the loan.


(b) Disclosure required prior to repaymentEach institution of higher education shall enter into an agreement with the Secretary under which the institution will, prior to the start of the repayment period of the student borrower on loans made under this part, disclose to the student borrower the information required under this subsection. Any disclosure required by this subsection may be made by an institution of higher education either in a promissory note evidencing the loan or loans or in a written statement provided to the borrower. The disclosures shall include—(1) the name of the institution of higher education, and the address to which communications and payments should be sent;
