Historical and Revision Notes


DerivationU.S. CodeRevised Statutes andStatutes at Large


 5 U.S.C. 43.R.S. § 169.June 26, 1930, ch. 618, 46 Stat. 817.
 5 U.S.C. 514d (2d par.).Sept. 21, 1944, ch. 412, § 709, 58 Stat. 743.


The authorization is restated to conform to the style of this title. The word “Executive agency” are substituted for “executive department, independent establishment” in view of the definitions in sections 103, 104, and 105. The source statute (an act to authorize the appointment of employees in the executive branch etc.) applied to the entire executive branch, and government corporations as well as other agencies in the executive branch were included within the words “independent establishment”. The words “or a military department” are inserted to preserve the application of the source statute. Before enactment of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 578), the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force were Executive departments. The National Security Act Amendments of 1949 established the Department of Defense as an Executive department including the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force as military departments, not as Executive departments. However, the source statute for this subsection, which was in effect in 1949, remained applicable to the Secretaries of the military departments by virtue of section 12(g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 591), which is set out in the reviser’s note for section 301. The words “for services in the District of Columbia or elsewhere” are eliminated as surplusage. The reference to chapter 51 is substituted for the reference to the Classification Act of 1923 because the Act of Oct. 28, 1949, ch. 782, § 1106(a), 63 Stat. 972, amended the section to refer to the Classification Act of 1949, which is carried into this title. The proviso in former section 43 and former section 514d (2d par.) are omitted as superseded by former section 22a, which is carried into section 302. The last sentence of the Act of June 26, 1930, is omitted as executed.
This section was part of title IV of the Revised Statutes. The Act of July 26, 1947, ch. 343, § 201(d), as added Aug. 10, 1949, ch. 412, § 4, 63 Stat. 579 (former 5 U.S.C. 171–1), which provides “Except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this Act [National Security Act of 1947], the provisions of title IV of the Revised Statutes as now or hereafter amended shall be applicable to the Department of Defense” is omitted from this title but is not repealed.
Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.

“(d) Compliance.—If, at any time during a fiscal year, the Office of Management and Budget notifies the President and the Congress that any requirement under subsection (b) is not met, no agency may hire any employee for any position in such agency until the Office of Management and Budget notifies the President and the Congress that the total number of full-time equivalent positions for all agencies equals or is less than the applicable number required under subsection (b).

For purposes of this subsection, positions and vacancies shall be counted on a full-time-equivalent basis.

“(2) Related restriction.—No funds budgeted for and appropriated by any Act for salaries or expenses of positions eliminated under this subsection may be used for any purpose other than authorized separation costs.

“(3) Applicability of backfill prevention provisions to agencies otherwise exempted from fte reduction.—“(A) In general.—If any agency is otherwise exempted by any law from the limitations on full-time equivalent positions or the restrictions on hiring established by this section—“(i) paragraph (1) shall apply to vacancies created in such agency; and

“(ii) the reductions required pursuant to clause (i) shall be made in the number of funded employee positions in such agency.


“(B) Waiver authority.—In the case of a particular position in an agency, subparagraph (A) may be waived upon a determination by the head of the agency that the performance of a critical agency mission requires the waiver.

“(C) Relation to other law.—No law may be construed as suspending or modifying this paragraph unless such law specifically amends this paragraph.



“(g) Limitation on Procurement of Service Contracts.—The President shall take appropriate action to ensure that there is no increase in the procurement of service contracts by reason of the enactment of this Act [see Tables for classification], except in cases in which a cost comparison demonstrates such contracts would be to the financial advantage of the Federal Government.”
