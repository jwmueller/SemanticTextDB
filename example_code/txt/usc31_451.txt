(d) Reservation for Adjustments.—The Secretary may reserve a percentage of not more than 2 percent of the amount under this section for a payment period for all units of general local government in a State if the Secretary considers the reserve is necessary to ensure the availability of sufficient amounts to pay adjustments after the final allocation of amounts among the units of general local government in the State.

(g) Nonsupplanting Requirement.—(1) In general.—Funds made available under this chapter to units of local government shall not be used to supplant State or local funds, but will be used to increase the amount of funds that would, in the absence of funds under this chapter, be made available from State or local sources.
