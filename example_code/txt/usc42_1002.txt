§ 300e–10. Restrictive State laws and practices(a) Entities operating as health maintenance organizationsIn the case of any entity—(1) which cannot do business as a health maintenance organization in a State in which it proposes to furnish basic and supplemental health services because that State by law, regulation, or otherwise—(A) requires as a condition to doing business in that State that a medical society approve the furnishing of services by the entity,
