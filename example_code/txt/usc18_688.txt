Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 104 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 50, 35 Stat. 1098; June 25, 1910, ch. 431, § 6, 36 Stat. 857).
Reference to persons aiding or procuring was deleted as unnecessary since such persons are made principals by section 2 of this title.
Maximum fine was increased from $500 to $1,000 to conform to other comparable sections of this chapter. (See sections 1851 and 1852 of this title.)
Minor changes were also made in phraseology.

Amendments1996—Pub. L. 104–294 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $1,000”.
