(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 742; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(K), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 78 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 33, 35 Stat. 1095).
Words “prize money” after “pension” were deleted as repealed by act Mar. 3, 1899, ch. 413, 30 Stat. 1007, repealing all laws authorizing prize money distribution.
Mandatory punishment was rephrased in the alternative.
In the punishment provision the words “five years” were substituted for “ten years” to harmonize it with the punishment provisions in sections 287 and 1001 of this title, covering similar offenses. (See reviser’s note under section 287 of this title.)

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000”.
