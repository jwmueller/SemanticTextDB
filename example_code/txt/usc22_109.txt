§ 262l–3. Environmental and energy initiatives; benchmarks; Global Warming Initiative; appropriations(a) Instructions to Executive Directors of Multilateral Development BanksIt is the policy of the United States that sustainable economic growth must be predicated on the sustainable management of natural resources. The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of each multilateral development bank (MDB) to continue to promote vigorously the environmental and energy initiatives established in section 533(a) of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1991 (Public Law 101–513). The Secretary of the Treasury, in cooperation with the Secretary of State, shall also undertake direct, bilateral discussions with appropriate officials of the governments of the member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development with a goal of building greater international support for the environmental goals established in subsection (d) of this section. The Secretary of the Treasury shall submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations by March 1, 1993, which describes the progress of these bilateral discussions.


(b) Report to CongressThe Secretary of the Treasury shall, not later than March 1, 1993, submit a report to the Congress containing the same information as requested in section 533(b) of Public Law 101–513.


(c) Improved environmental performance; benchmarks(1) In furtherance of the policies contained in section 533(a) of Public Law 101–513 and section 1308 11 See References in Text note below. of the International Development and Finance Act of 1989 (Public Law 101–240), and as a basis for measuring more effectively progress by the MDBs toward improved environmental performance, the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Directors of the MDBs to encourage each MDB, at a minimum, to meet the benchmarks established in paragraph (2) in the areas of sustainable energy development, forest conservation, forced displacement of populations, and environmental impact assessment. On March 1, 1993 and March 1, 1994, the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit a report to the Congress describing in detail the progress being made by the MDBs in meeting these benchmarks.

(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), benchmarks are as follows:(A) In the area of sustainable energy development—(i) all loans in the energy sector should be based on, or support development of, “least-cost” integrated resource plans. Such plans shall include analyses of possible end-use energy efficiency measures and nonconventional renewable energy options, and such plans shall reflect the quantifiable environmental costs of proposed energy developments;

(ii) a substantial portion of loans and grants in the energy, industry, and transportation sectors shall be devoted to end-use energy efficiency improvements and nonconventional renewable energy development; and

(iii) all organizational units within the MDBs should create staff positions in a management role in end-use efficiency and renewable energy, which positions shall be staffed by individuals with professional experience in program design and management and educational degrees in relevant technical disciplines.


(B) In the area of forest conservation—(i) forestry loans should not support commercial logging in relatively undisturbed primary forests, nor should loans result in any significant loss of tropical forests;

(ii) forestry loans should not be disbursed until legal, economic, land tenure, and other policy conditions needed to ensure sustainability are in place;

(iii) loans should not support mineral, petroleum, or other industrial development in, or construction or upgrading of roads through, relatively undisturbed primary forests unless adequate safeguards and monitoring systems, developed in consultation with local populations, are already in place to prevent degradation of the surrounding forests;

(iv) loans should be consistent with and support the needs and rights of indigenous peoples and other long-term forest inhabitants and should not be made to countries which have shown an unwillingness to resolve fairly the territorial claims of such people; and

(v) support for protection of biological diversity, in close consultation with local communities, should be increased to account for a larger proportion of MDB lending.


(C) In the area of forced displacement of populations—(i) the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and Asian Development Bank should maintain a listing, available to the Secretary of the Treasury, of all ongoing projects involving forced displacement of populations, including the number of people displaced and a report on the status of the implementation of their resettlement policy guidelines for each such project, and obtain agreements with borrowers to ensure that all ongoing projects involving forced displacement will be in full compliance with their resettlement policy guidelines by mid-1993; and

(ii) the African Development Bank should adopt and implement policy guidelines on forced displacement similar to such guidelines of the other MDBs.


(D) In the area of procedures for environmental impact assessment (EIA)—(i) each MDB should require that draft and final EIA reports be made available to the public in borrowing and donor countries and that the public be offered timely opportunities for comment on the EIA process, including initial scoping sessions, review of EIA categories assigned to individual projects, and opportunities to comment on draft and final EIA reports;

(ii) each MDB should apply EIA requirements to all sector loans and develop and apply the methodology for environmental assessment of structural adjustment loans;

(iii) each MDB should require that the EIA process include analyses of the potential impacts of proposed projects on the global environment; and

(iv) each MDB should require the head of the appropriate environmental unit, rather than project officers, determine the appropriate type of environmental analysis required under the bank’s EIA procedures.




(d) Global Warming InitiativeThe Administrator of the Agency for International Development shall instruct all Agency missions and bureaus to continue to implement all elements of the “Global Warming Initiative” as defined in, and which may continue under, the authorities of sections 22 So in original. Probably should be “section”. 533(c)(1) through (4) of Public Law 101–513. The Initiative shall continue to emphasize the need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases through strategies consistent with continued economic development, such as forest conservation, end-use energy efficiency, least-cost energy planning, and renewable energy development. The Administrator shall direct Agency mission directors to incorporate these strategies in their country programs.
