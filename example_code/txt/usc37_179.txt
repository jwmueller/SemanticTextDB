The allowance shall be paid jointly to both members.


(b) Secondary Allowance Authorized Under Certain Circumstances.—(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, whenever a member is entitled to a primary dislocation allowance under subsection (a) as a member described in paragraph (2)(C) or (2)(D)(ii) of such subsection, the member is also entitled to a secondary dislocation allowance at the rate determined under subsection (c) for the member’s pay grade and dependency status if, subsequent to the member or the member’s dependents actually moving from their place of residence under circumstances described in section 476a of this title, the member or member’s dependents complete that move to a new location and then actually move from that new location to another location also under circumstances described in section 476a of this title.

Effective on the same date that the monthly rates of basic pay for members are increased for a subsequent calendar year, the Secretary of Defense shall adjust the rates for the dislocation allowance for that calendar year by the percentage equal to the average percentage increase in the rates of basic pay for that calendar year.
