If the officer is not on active duty, the President may order him to active duty, with his consent, to serve as a property and fiscal officer.

(b) Each property and fiscal officer shall—(1) receipt and account for all funds and property of the United States in the possession of the National Guard for which he is property and fiscal officer; and

(e) The Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Air Force shall prescribe joint regulations necessary to carry out subsections (a)–(d).

(f) A property and fiscal officer may intrust money to an officer of the National Guard to make disbursements as his agent. Both the officer to whom money is intrusted, and the property and disbursing officer intrusting the money to him, are pecuniarily responsible for that money to the United States. The agent officer is subject, for misconduct as an agent, to the liabilities and penalties prescribed by law in like cases for the property and fiscal officer for whom he is acting.
