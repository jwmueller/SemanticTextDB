810446:23546:405(b)46:673


Section 8104 prescribes certain working hours and conditions under which working hours are set. The Committee intends that these sections be interpreted in a manner consistent with one another.
Subsection (a) permits an individual to take charge of the deck watch on leaving port and immediately thereafter only if the individual has been off duty for 6 of the 12 hours immediately prior to departure.
Subsection (b) prohibits a licensed individual from being required to work more than 9 of 24 hours in port or more than 12 of 24 hours at sea on an oceangoing or coastwise vessel of not more than 100 gross tons, except in an emergency.
Subsection (c) prescribes a maximum 8-hour day for licensed individuals and seamen on towing vessels operating on the Great Lakes and certain connecting or tributary waters.
Subsection (d) requires certain members of the complement of certain merchant vessels of more than 100 gross tons to be divided into at least 3 successive watches when at sea. This requirement applies to radio officers only when at least 3 radio officers are employed. Subsection (d) also prescribes a maximum 8-hour work day for licensed individuals and seamen on these vessels.
For the Great Lakes towing vessels and merchant vessels in subsections (c) and (d), subsection (e) requires that seamen be hired only for work in either the deck or the engine department. When in a safe harbor, seamen may be required to do only necessary work on Sundays and certain holidays, unless the vessel is getting underway on a voyage. Further, when in a safe harbor, this subsection restates the maximum 8-hour work day which applies even for anchor watch.
Subsection (f) states that the limitations in subsections (d) and (e) do not apply if the master or other officer decides the crew is needed for certain routine, safety, or rescue activities.
Subsection (g) provides that for a towing vessel (except a Great Lakes towing vessel under subsection (c)), offshore supply vessel, or barge on a voyage of less than 600 miles, the licensed officers and certain crewmembers may be divided into not less than two watches when at sea.
Subsection (h) provides that the licensed operator for a towing vessel at least 26 feet long may not be required to work more than 12 of 24 hours, except in an emergency.
Subsections (i) and (j) prescribe penalties for violations of the provisions of this section and, in certain instances, entitles the seaman to discharge and payment of wages.
