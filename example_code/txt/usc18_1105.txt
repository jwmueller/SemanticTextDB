(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 828; Pub. L. 110–329, div. C, title VIII, § 8117, Sept. 30, 2008, 122 Stat. 3647; Pub. L. 110–417, [div. A], title VIII, § 855, Oct. 14, 2008, 122 Stat. 4545; Pub. L. 111–84, div. A, title X, § 1073(c)(7), Oct. 28, 2009, 123 Stat. 2475.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 590a (Aug. 24, 1942, ch. 555, § 1, 56 Stat. 747; July 1, 1944, ch. 358, § 19(b), 58 Stat. 667; Oct. 3, 1944, ch. 479, § 28, 58 Stat. 781).
The phrase “when the United States is at war” was inserted at the beginning of this section to make it permanent instead of temporary legislation, and to obviate the necessity of reenacting such legislation in the future. This permitted the elimination of references to dates and to the provision limiting the application of the section to transactions not yet fully barred. When the provisions of the War Contract Settlements Act of 1944, upon which this section is based, are considered in connection with said section 590a which it amends, it is obvious that no purpose can be served now by the provisions omitted.
Phrase (2), reading “or committed in connection with the acquisition, care, handling, custody, control or disposition of any real or personal property of the United States” was derived from section 28 of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 which amended said section 590a of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. This act is temporary by its terms and relates only to offenses committed in the disposition of surplus property thereunder.
The revised section extends its provisions to all offenses involving the disposition of any property, real or personal, of the United States. This extension is more apparent than real since phrase (2), added as the result of said Act, was merely a more specific statement of offenses embraced in phrase (1) of this section.
The revised section is written in general terms as permanent legislation applicable whenever the United States is at war. (See, also, reviser’s note under section 284 of this title.)
The last paragraph was added to obviate any possibility of doubt as to meaning of terms defined in section 103 of title 41, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Contracts.
Changes were made in phraseology.
