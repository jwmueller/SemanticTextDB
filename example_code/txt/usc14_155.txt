Historical and Revision Notes
1949 ActBased on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§ 35, 35a, 206 (May 26, 1906, ch. 2556, § 1, 34 Stat. 200; Jan. 28, 1915, ch. 20, § 1, 38 Stat. 800; Apr. 21, 1924, ch. 130, § 6, 43 Stat. 106; July 30, 1937, ch. 545, § 1, 50 Stat. 547; July 11, 1941, ch. 290, § 8, 55 Stat. 586; Aug. 18, 1941, ch. 364, § 3, 55 Stat. 629).
Section 35 of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., has been divided. The provisions of the first sentence of subsection (a) are placed in this section. The proviso of subsection (a) is covered in section 367(b) of this title. Subsection (b) is placed in section 365 of this title. Subsections (c) and (d) are placed in section 367(a) of this title, except that part (3) of subsection (c) is covered by section 366 of this title.
Section 206 of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., has been divided. That part dealing with special temporary enlistments is incorporated in this section. That part dealing with temporary appointments of warrant officers is placed in section 302 of this title.
Certain additional details concerning the two types of enlistments are added; these details were previously covered in Coast Guard Regulations.
This section makes provision for the enlistment of personnel in the Coast Guard. The first sentence grants the necessary authority to the Secretary, changes existing law in regard to the term of enlistment from “not to exceed four years” to “not to exceed six years”, and adds a provision for the enlistment of minors for their minority only, such provision being in accordance with existing law applicable to the Navy. The next three sentences establish and define the two types of enlistments that are now in effect in the Coast Guard, setting forth the basic difference in the two types. The last sentence continues a provision to the effect that original enlistments in the Coast Guard shall be temporary. This section is a combination of existing law and regulations in regard to enlistments, with changes as noted above. See title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 35, and Coast Guard Regulations, sections 531 and 532. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.
