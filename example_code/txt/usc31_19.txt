The words “applicable to anyone” are substituted for “to the several collectors, receivers, depositaries, officers, and others” for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words. In subclause (A), the words “for the Government” are inserted because section 8 of the Act of June 30, 1864 (ch. 172, 13 Stat. 221), from which section 251 of the Revised Statutes is derived, used the phrase “in behalf of the United States”. In subclause (B), the words “those notes and securities” are substituted for “the same” for clarity.
In subsection (a)(6), the word “collect” is substituted for “superintend the collection” because of the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title. The word “receipts” is substituted for “revenue” for consistency in the revised title.

In subsection (b)(4), before subclause (A), the word “detail” is substituted for “to use for, and in connection with” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “in addition to details authorized under another law” are substituted for 31:1017(last sentence) to eliminate unnecessary words and because subsequent laws would also provide additional authority to detail. The words “and the several branches of the public service under its control” are omitted as being included in “Department”. The words “officers and employees” are substituted for “persons” for clarity and consistency in the revised title. In subclause (B), the words “agents or from the appropriation for the foregoing purpose” are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement.
