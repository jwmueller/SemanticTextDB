(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 754; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(L), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 85 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 35, 35 Stat. 1095; Oct. 23, 1918, ch. 194, 40 Stat. 1015; June 18, 1934, ch. 587, 48 Stat. 996; Apr. 4, 1938, ch. 69, 52 Stat. 197).
Word “agency” was substituted for “department” so as to eliminate any possible ambiguity as to scope of section. (See definitions of “department” and “agency” in section 6 of this title.)
Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “principal” in section 2 of this title.
Minor changes were made in phraseology.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $10,000”.
