Appropriate references are made to dental care throughout the section to reflect the fact that in certain limited situations dependents are entitled to dental care under 37:403(h)(4), restated as section 1077 of this title.
In subsection (a), the words “appointed, enlisted, inducted or called, ordered or conscripted in a uniformed service” are omitted as surplusage, since it does not matter how a member became a member. The words “active duty for a period of more than 30 days” are substituted for the words “active duty or active duty for training pursuant to a call or order that does not specify a period of thirty days or less” to reflect section 101(22) and (23) of this title.
In subsection (b), the words “active duty (other than for training)” are substituted for the words “active duty as defined in section 901(b) of title 50” to reflect section 101(22) of this title. The words “retirement” and “retirement pay” are omitted as surplusage.
In subsection (c), 37:421(c) (last 28 words) is omitted as unnecessary since this subsection and section 1077 of this title are written so as to apply to subsection (b) as well as subsection (a).
In subsection (d), the words “because the facility concerned is that of a uniformed service other than that of the member” is substituted for the words “because of the service affiliation of the service member”.
