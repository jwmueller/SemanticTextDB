Congressional Resolution 4–60 adopted by the 4th Congress of the Federated States of Micronesia on March 26, 1986 and Resolution No. 62 adopted by the Nitijela of the Marshall Islands on February 18, 1986 do not exclude, limit or modify any provision of the Compact of Free Association as approved by the United States. To the extent that any understandings, interpretations, and policy statements contained in such Resolutions are inconsistent with the provisions of Public Law 99–239, the United States does not concur therein. The President shall take such steps, including but not limited to, communicating with the Governments of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, as may be necessary to preserve all rights of the United States in connection with interpretation and implementation of such Public Law.


(h) Additional provisions relating to Title Three of Compact(1) The Government of the United States recognizes and respects the scarcity and special importance of land in Palau. In making any designation of land pursuant to section 322 of the Compact, the Government of the United States shall follow the policy of requesting the minimum area necessary to accomplish the required security and defense purpose, of requesting only the minimum interest in real property necessary to support such purpose, and of requesting first to satisfy the requirement through public real property, where available, rather than through private real property.

(2) The Armed Forces of other nations invited to use military areas and facilities in Palau pursuant to section 312 of the Compact shall be permitted only as it is incident to the authority and under the control of the United States. The activities of such third country forces shall be subject to the same limitations and restrictions applicable to the authority of the United States under the terms of the Compact.

(3) The Government of the United States considers “Exclusive use” areas established for the United States pursuant to Title Three of the Compact to be “within the jurisdiction of Palau,” as that term is used in section 324 of the Compact.


(i) Availability of appropriationsNotwithstanding any other provision of law, funds appropriated for the Compact of Free Association, Public Law 99–239 [48 U.S.C. 1901 et seq., 2001 et seq.], or this joint resolution, in the act of making supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 1986, shall remain available until expended.


(j) Authority to contract or make payments(1), (2) Omitted

(3) No authority under this subsection to enter into contracts or to make payments shall be effective except to the extent and in such amounts as provided in advance in appropriations Acts. Any provision of this subsection which authorizes the enactment of new budget authority shall be effective only for fiscal years beginning after September 30, 1985.


(k) Annual reportThe Departments of Energy and Interior are directed to provide the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate with a report by December 1 of each fiscal year detailing how funds were spent during the previous fiscal year for the special medical care and logistical support program for Rongelap and Utrik and for the agriculture and food programs for Eniwetok and Bikini as referenced in Section 103(h) of Public Law 99–239 [48 U.S.C. 1903(h)]. The report shall also specify the anticipated needs during the current and following fiscal years in order to meet the radiological health care and logistical support program for Rongelap and Utrik and the planting, agricultural maintenance, and food programs for Eniwetok and Bikini. It is the sense of the Congress that the special medical care and logistical support program for Rongelap and Utrik and for the agriculture and food programs for Eniwetok and Bikini described in section 103(h) of Public Law 99–239 represent special and continuing moral commitments of the United States which will be annually funded to the extent of the need of the populations of such atolls for such assistance.
