§ 638. Research and development(a) Declaration of policyResearch and development are major factors in the growth and progress of industry and the national economy. The expense of carrying on research and development programs is beyond the means of many small-business concerns, and such concerns are handicapped in obtaining the benefits of research and development programs conducted at Government expense. These small-business concerns are thereby placed at a competitive disadvantage. This weakens the competitive free enterprise system and prevents the orderly development of the national economy. It is the policy of the Congress that assistance be given to small-business concerns to enable them to undertake and to obtain the benefits of research and development in order to maintain and strengthen the competitive free enterprise system and the national economy.


(b) Assistance to small-business concernsIt shall be the duty of the Administration, and it is empowered—(1) to assist small-business concerns to obtain Government contracts for research and development;

(2) to assist small-business concerns to obtain the benefits of research and development performed under Government contracts or at Government expense;

(3) to provide technical assistance to small-business concerns to accomplish the purposes of this section; and 11 So in original. The word “and” probably should not appear.

(4) to develop and maintain a source file and an information program to assure each qualified and interested small business concern the opportunity to participate in Federal agency small business innovation research programs and small business technology transfer programs;

(5) to coordinate with participating agencies a schedule for release of SBIR and STTR solicitations, and to prepare a master release schedule so as to maximize small businesses’ opportunities to respond to solicitations;

(6) to independently survey and monitor the operation of SBIR and STTR programs within participating Federal agencies;

(7) to report not less than annually to the Committee on Small Business of the Senate, and to the Committee on Science and the Committee on Small Business of the House of Representatives, on the SBIR and STTR programs of the Federal agencies and the Administration’s information and monitoring efforts related to the SBIR and STTR programs, including—(A) the data on output and outcomes collected pursuant to subsections (g)(8) and (o)(9);

(B) the number of proposals received from, and the number and total amount of awards to, HUBZone small business concerns and firms with venture capital, hedge fund, or private equity firm investment (including those majority-owned by multiple venture capital operating companies, hedge funds, or private equity firms) under each of the SBIR and STTR programs;

(C) a description of the extent to which each Federal agency is increasing outreach and awards to firms owned and controlled by women or by socially or economically disadvantaged individuals under each of the SBIR and STTR programs;

(8) to provide for and fully implement the tenets of Executive Order No. 13329 (Encouraging Innovation in Manufacturing); and
