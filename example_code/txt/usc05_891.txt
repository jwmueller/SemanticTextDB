(2) section 8113(a) of this title applies to an enrollee; and

(3) “performance of duty” does not include an act of an enrollee while absent from his assigned post of duty, except while participating in an activity (including an activity while on pass or during travel to or from the post of duty) authorized by or under the direction and supervision of the Job Corps.


(b) This subchapter applies to a volunteer in service to America who receives either a living allowance or a stipend under part A of subchapter VIII of chapter 34 of title 42, with respect to that service and training, to the same extent as enrollees of the Job Corps under subsection (a) of this section.
