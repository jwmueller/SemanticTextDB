In subsections (a) and (b), the words “General Accounting Office” are substituted for the words “accounting officers”, for clarity.
In subsection (a), the word “member” is substituted for the words “officers or enlisted persons”, in 10:868 and 34:941a. The words “his legal representative” are substituted for the words “a duly appointed legal representative of the estate”, since an estate, being property and not an entity, has no representative. The words “duly appointed” are omitted as surplusage. The words “highest on the following list” are substituted for the words “following order of precedence”, in 10:868 and 34:941a. Clauses (1)–(4) are substituted for the words between the first and second colons of 10:868 and 34:941a. The words “Surviving spouse” are substituted for the words “widow or widower” after the words “First, to”.

In subsection (a), the definition of the term “Department”, in 37:361, is omitted as unnecessary, since the particular departments referred to are spelled out in the revised text. The definition of the term “uniformed services”, in 37:361, is omitted as covered by the word “member” in this revised section and by sections 3 and 4 of the Act enacting this revised section. Clauses (1)–(6) are substituted for the last 5 clauses of 37:362. The words “regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary concerned” are substituted for the words “regulations of the Department concerned”, since the “Department”, as such, cannot issue regulations.
