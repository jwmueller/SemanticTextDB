The words “is retired, or to whom retired pay is granted” are substituted for the words “heretofore or hereafter retired or granted retirement pay”. The words “any other member of the armed forces” are substituted for the words “all members of the reserve components”, since the words “reserve components” are defined by section 102(k) of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 805 (37 U.S.C. 231(k)), to include members appointed, enlisted, or inducted without component.
