(b) Increased Government Share.—If, under subsection (a) of this section, the Government’s share of allowable costs of a project in a State containing unappropriated and unreserved public lands and nontaxable Indian lands (individual and tribal) of more than 5 percent of the total area of all lands in the State, is less than the share applied on June 30, 1975, under section 17(b) of the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970, the Government’s share under subsection (a) of this section shall be increased by the lesser of—(1) 25 percent;

(3) the percentage necessary to increase the Government’s share to the percentage that applied on June 30, 1975, under section 17(b) of the Act.


(c) Grandfather Rule.—(1) In general.—In the case of any project approved after September 30, 2003, at a small hub airport or nonhub airport that is located in a State containing unappropriated and unreserved public lands and nontaxable Indian lands (individual and tribal) of more than 5 percent of the total area of all lands in the State, the Government’s share of allowable costs of the project shall be increased by the same ratio as the basic share of allowable costs of a project divided into the increased (Public Lands States) share of allowable costs of a project as shown on documents of the Federal Aviation Administration dated August 3, 1979, at airports for which the general share was 80 percent on August 3, 1979. This subsection shall apply only if—(A) the State contained unappropriated and unreserved public lands and nontaxable Indian lands of more than 5 percent of the total area of all lands in the State on August 3, 1979; and

(B) the application under subsection (b), does not increase the Government’s share of allowable costs of the project.

(d) Special Rule for Privately Owned Reliever Airports.—If a privately owned reliever airport contributes any lands, easements, or rights-of-way to carry out a project under this subchapter, the current fair market value of such lands, easements, or rights-of-way shall be credited toward the non-Federal share of allowable project costs.

(e) Special Rule for Transition From Small Hub to Medium Hub Status.—If the status of a small hub airport changes to a medium hub airport, the Government’s share of allowable project costs for the airport may not exceed 90 percent for the first 2 fiscal years after such change in hub status.

(f) Special Rule for Economically Distressed Communities.—The Government’s share of allowable project costs shall be 95 percent for a project at an airport that—(1) is receiving essential air service for which compensation was provided to an air carrier under subchapter II of chapter 417; and

(2) is located in an area that meets one or more of the criteria established in section 301(a) of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3161(a)), as determined by the Secretary of Commerce.

In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words “Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section” are substituted for “Except as otherwise provided in this chapter” because subsections (b) and (c) restate the only parts of the chapter that provide exceptions to the general rule stated in subsection (a). In clauses (1) and (2), the words “for a project” are substituted for “payable on account of any project contained in an approved project grant application submitted in accordance with this chapter” in 49 App.:2209(a) and “payable on account of any project contained in an approved project grant application” in 49 App.:2209(b) for consistency in this chapter and to eliminate unnecessary words. A project cost is allowable only if it is incurred under a grant agreement made under the chapter, and a grant agreement may be made only if the project grant application is approved. In clause (1), the words “number of passenger boardings” are substituted for “enplaning . . . of the . . . passengers enplaned” because of the definition of “passenger boardings” in section 47102 of the revised title.
In subsection (b), the words “If, under subsection (a) of this section, the Government’s share of allowable costs . . . is less than the share applied on June 30, 1975, under section 17(b) of the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970” and “(3) the percentage necessary to increase the Government’s share to the percentage that applied on June 30, 1975, under section 17(b) of the Act” are substituted for 49 App.:2209(c) (last sentence) for clarity. The words “of the total of all lands therein” are omitted as surplus.
In subsection (c), the words “Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section” are substituted for “Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter” because subsections (a) and (b) are the only other parts of the chapter that specify the United States Government’s share of allowable project costs.
