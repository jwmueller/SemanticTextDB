In subsection (a), the words “Notwithstanding any other provision of law” and “for such positions” are omitted as surplusage. The last sentence is substituted for 10:61a (last sentence). 10:21h(c) is omitted as covered by 10:61a.
In subsection (b), the words “Hereafter” and “exclusive of the present incumbents” are omitted as surplusage.
In subsection (c), the words “In addition to duties elsewhere prescribed for him by law”, in 10:62, are omitted as surplusage. The words “and perform such other duties as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Army”, in 10:62, are omitted as superseded by sections 3012(e) and 3036(d) of this title. Clause (2) is substituted for 10:62a (words after semicolon) and 63. The Act of June 23, 1874, ch. 458, § 2 (words before semicolon of 1st sentence, and last sentence), 18 Stat. 244, are not contained in 10:62. They are also omitted from the revised section as superseded by sections 3037(a) and 3211 of this title.

1958 ActThe change corrects an inadvertence. The source statute for section 3036(c) of title 10 (the third sentence of sec. 513(a) of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 901), providing for a 4-year term of office, applied also to the Judge Advocate General and the Assistant Judge Advocate General. As restated in section 3036(c), it now applies only to the officers named in section 3036(b), which excludes the two officers named. For this reason, the effect of the source statute with respect to those officers is added to section 3037(a), relating to their appointment.
