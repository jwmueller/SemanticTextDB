§ 53312. Assessment and collection of deficiency tax
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a deficiency in tax for a taxable year resulting from the inclusion of an amount in gross income as provided by section 53311 of this title, and the amount to be treated as a deficiency under section 53311 instead of as an adjustment for the declared value excess profits tax, may be assessed or a civil action may be brought to collect the deficiency without assessment, at any time. Interest on a deficiency or amount to be treated as a deficiency does not begin until the date the deposited gain or part of the deposited gain in question is required to be included in gross income under section 51111.
