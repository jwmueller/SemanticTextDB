§ 2660. Copies of treaties furnished to Public Printer
The Secretary of State shall furnish to the Public Printer a correct copy of every treaty between the United States and any foreign government as soon as possible after it has been duly ratified and has been proclaimed by the President; and also of every postal convention made between the United States Postal Service, by and with the advice and consent of the President, on the part of the United States and foreign countries, as soon as possible after copies of such conventions have been transmitted to him by the United States Postal Service.
(R.S. § 210; June 20, 1874, ch. 328, 18 Stat. 88; 1950 Reorg. Plan No. 20, § 1, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3178, 64 Stat. 1272; Pub. L. 91–375, § 4(a), Aug. 12, 1970, 84 Stat. 773.)

Codification
R.S. § 210 derived from acts Mar. 9, 1868, ch. 22, § 1, 15 Stat. 40; June 8, 1872, ch. 335, § 20, 17 Stat. 287.
Section was formerly classified to section 165 of Title 5 prior to the general revision and enactment of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees, by Pub. L. 89–554, § 1, Sept. 6, 1966, 80 Stat. 378.
Provisions of R.S. § 210, act June 20, 1874, and 1950 Reorg. Plan No. 20, cited as credits to this section, insofar as related to duty of Administrator of General Services to furnish to Public Printer a correct copy of every Act and joint resolution, as soon as possible after its approval by President, or after it has become a law in accordance with the Constitution without such approval, were classified to section 191a of former Title 44, Public Printing and Documents, prior to repeal and reenactment as section 710 of Title 44 by Pub. L. 90–620, which enacted Title 44. Section 2(a) of Pub. L. 90–620 provided that the legislative purpose in enacting Title 44 was to restate without substantive change the laws replaced by revised Title 44. Because revised section 710 of Title 44 did not restate those provisions of R.S. § 210 and act June 20, 1874, which appear in this section, this section is not considered as having been repealed by section 3 of Pub. L. 90–620.


Transfer of Functions
Reorg. Plan No. 20 of 1950, set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees, transferred various functions of Secretary of State to Administrator of General Services but excepted from transfer the functions of Secretary of State with respect to treaties and other international agreements under R.S. § 210, as amended (this section).
“United States Postal Service” substituted in text for “Postmaster General” pursuant to section 4(a) of Pub. L. 91–375, set out as a note under section 201 of Title 39, Postal Service, which abolished office of Postmaster General of Post Office Department and transferred its functions to United States Postal Service.
