The Secretary may allocate assistance under the preceding sentence in such a manner that each State shall receive not less than one-half of one percent of the amount of funds available for each program referred to in subsection (a)(1) of this section in each fiscal year. In allocating assistance under this paragraph for each program of housing assistance under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall apply the formula, to the extent practicable, in a manner so that the assistance under the program is allocated according to the particular relative needs under the preceding sentence that are characteristic of and related to the particular type of assistance provided under the program.

(ii) Assistance under section 8(o) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)] shall be allocated in a manner that enables participating jurisdictions to carry out, to the maximum extent practicable, comprehensive housing affordability strategies approved in accordance with section 105 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act [42 U.S.C. 12705]. Such jurisdictions shall submit recommendations for allocating assistance under such section 8(o) to the Secretary in accordance with procedures that the Secretary determines to be appropriate to permit allocations of such assistance to be made on the basis of timely and complete information. This clause may not be construed to prevent, alter, or otherwise affect the application of the formula established pursuant to clause (i) for purposes of allocating such assistance. For purposes of this clause, the term “participating jurisdiction” means a State or unit of general local government designated by the Secretary to be a participating jurisdiction under title II of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act [42 U.S.C. 12721 et seq.].

(C) Any allocation of assistance under subparagraph (A) shall, as determined by the Secretary, be made to the smallest practicable area, consistent with the delivery of assistance through a meaningful competitive process designed to serve areas with greater needs.

(D) Any amounts allocated to a State or areas or communities within a State that are not likely to be used within a fiscal year shall not be reallocated for use in another State, unless the Secretary determines that other areas or communities (that are eligible for assistance under the program) within the same State cannot use the amounts within that same fiscal year.


(2) The Secretary may reserve such housing assistance funds as he deems appropriate for use by a State or agency thereof.

(3)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, with respect to fiscal years beginning after September 30, 1990, the Secretary may retain not more than 5 percent of the financial assistance that becomes available under programs described in subsection (a)(1) of this section during any fiscal year. Any such financial assistance that is retained shall be available for subsequent allocation to specific areas and communities, and may only be used for—(i) unforeseen housing needs resulting from natural and other disasters;

(ii) housing needs resulting from emergencies, as certified by the Secretary, other than such disasters;

(iii) housing needs resulting from the settlement of litigation; and

Such amounts shall be allocated on the basis of the formula under subsection (d)(1) of this section.


(4)(A) The Secretary shall not reserve or obligate assistance subject to allocation under paragraph (1)(A) to specific recipients, unless the assistance is first allocated on the basis of the formula contained in that paragraph and then is reserved and obligated pursuant to a competition.

(B) Any competition referred to in subparagraph (A) shall be conducted pursuant to specific criteria for the selection of recipients of assistance. The criteria shall be contained in—(i) a regulation promulgated by the Secretary after notice and public comment; or

(ii) to the extent authorized by law, a notice published in the Federal Register.


(C) Subject to the times at which appropriations for assistance subject to paragraph (1)(A) may become available for reservation in any fiscal year, the Secretary shall take such steps as the Secretary deems appropriate to ensure that, to the maximum extent practicable, the process referred to in subparagraph (A) is carried out with similar frequency and at similar times for each fiscal year.

(D) This paragraph shall not apply to assistance referred to in paragraph (4).3



(e) Assistance payments for properties in Jefferson County, TexasFrom budget authority made available in appropriation Acts for fiscal year 1988, the Secretary shall enter into an annual contributions contract for a term of 180 months to obligate sufficient funds to provide assistance payments pursuant to section 8(b)(1) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437f(b)(1)] on behalf of 500 lower income families from budget authority made available for fiscal year 1988, so long as such families occupy properties in Jefferson County, Texas. If a lower income family receiving assistance payments pursuant to this subsection ceases to qualify for assistance payments pursuant to the provisions of section 8 of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1437f] or of this subsection during the 180-month term of the annual contributions contract, assistance payments shall be made on behalf of another lower income family who occupies a unit identified in the previous sentence.
