“SEC. 1410. DESIGNATION OF CRUISE VESSEL NO-DISCHARGE ZONES.“If the State of Alaska determines that the protection and enhancement of the quality of some or all of the waters of the Alexander Archipelago or the navigable waters of the United States within the State of Alaska or within the Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve require greater environmental protection, the State of Alaska may petition the Administrator to prohibit the discharge of graywater and sewage from cruise vessels operating in such waters. The establishment of such a prohibition shall be achieved in the same manner as the petitioning process and prohibition of the discharge of sewage pursuant to section 312(f) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act [33 U.S.C. 1322(f)], as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
