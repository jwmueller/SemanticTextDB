(c) Ownership Requirements for Entities.—(1) In general.—A vessel owned by an entity is eligible for a fishery endorsement only if at least 75 percent of the interest in the entity, at each tier of ownership and in the aggregate, is owned and controlled by citizens of the United States.

(2) Determining 75 percent interest.—In determining whether at least 75 percent of the interest in the entity is owned and controlled by citizens of the United States under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall apply section 50501(d) of this title, except that for this purpose the terms “control” or “controlled”—(A) include the right to—(i) direct the business of the entity;

(B) the owner of the vessel demonstrates to the Secretary that—(i) the regional fishery management council of jurisdiction established under section 302(a)(1) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1852(a)(1)) has recommended after October 21, 1998, and the Secretary of Commerce has approved, conservation and management measures in accordance with the American Fisheries Act (Public Law 105–277, div. C, title II) (16 U.S.C. 1851 note) 11 See References in Text note below. to allow the vessel to be used in fisheries under the council’s authority; and

(e) Vessels Measuring 100 Feet or Greater.—(1) In general.—The Administrator of the Maritime Administration shall administer subsections (c) and (d) with respect to vessels 100 feet or greater in registered length. The owner of each such vessel shall file a statement of citizenship setting forth all relevant facts regarding vessel ownership and control with the Administrator on an annual basis to demonstrate compliance with those provisions.

(2) Regulations.—Regulations to implement this subsection shall conform to the extent practicable with the regulations establishing the form of citizenship affidavit set forth in part 355 of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on September 25, 1997, except that the form of the statement shall be written in a manner to allow the owner of the vessel to satisfy any annual renewal requirements for a certificate of documentation for the vessel and to comply with this subsection and subsections (c) and (d), and shall not be required to be notarized.

(3) Transfer of ownership.—Transfers of ownership and control of vessels subject to subsection (c) or (d), which are 100 feet or greater in registered length, shall be rigorously scrutinized for violations of those provisions, with particular attention given to—(A) leases, charters, mortgages, financing, and similar arrangements;

(i) Regulations.—Regulations to implement subsections (c) and (d) and sections 12151(c) and 31322(b) of this title shall prohibit impermissible transfers of ownership or control, specify any transactions that require prior approval of an implementing agency, identify transactions that do not require prior agency approval, and to the extent practicable, minimize disruptions to the commercial fishing industry, to the traditional financing arrangements of that industry, and to the opportunity to form fishery cooperatives.

In subsection (b)(1), the word “only” is omitted because section 12102(a), as revised by the bill, contains a general requirement for appropriate documentation to engage in any trade.
In subsection (c)(1), the word “entity” is substituted for “corporation, partnership, association, trust, joint venture, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, or any other entity” to eliminate unnecessary words.

References in TextThe American Fisheries Act (Public Law 105–277, div. C, title II) (16 U.S.C. 1851 note), referred to in subsec. (d)(2)(B)(i), probably should be a reference to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (see note below). Introductory provisions and cl. (i) of subsec. (d)(2)(B) of this section were derived from former section 12102(c)(5)(B) of this title in the general amendment of this chapter by Pub. L. 109–304, § 5, Oct. 6, 2006, 120 Stat. 1491. As part of that amendment, the reference to the American Fisheries Act was substituted for a reference to “such Act” which had been preceded by references to both of the above named Acts. See the Historical and Revision Notes above and section 2 of Pub. L. 109–304, set out as a Legislative Purpose and Construction note preceding section 101 of this title.
Section 208(e) and (g) of the American Fisheries Act, referred to in subsec. (d)(2)(B)(ii), (C)(i), (iii), is section 208(e) and (g), respectively, of title II of div. C of Pub. L. 105–277, Oct. 21, 1998, 112 Stat. 2681–625, 2681–627, which is set out in a note under section 1851 of Title 16, Conservation.
Section 219(a)(7) of the Department of Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2005, referred to in subsec. (d)(2)(B)(ii), (C)(iii), is section 219(a)(7) of Pub. L. 108–447, div. B, title II, Dec. 8, 2004, 118 Stat. 2887, which is not classified to the Code.
The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, referred to in subsec. (g), is Pub. L. 94–265, Apr. 13, 1976, 90 Stat. 331, which is classified principally to chapter 38 (§ 1801 et seq.) of Title 16, Conservation. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 1801 of Title 16 and Tables.
