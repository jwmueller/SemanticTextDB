The words “the senior officer present afloat” are substituted for the words “The commanding officer of any fleet, squadron, or vessel acting singly”. At the time of enactment of the Revised Statutes, the word “squadron” meant any number of vessels more than one. Today the concept of “senior officer present afloat” covers as nearly as possible the current equivalent of the original statute.
