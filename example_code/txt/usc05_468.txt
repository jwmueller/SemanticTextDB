The provisos in paragraphs (39) and (46) of former section 2211(c) are carried into section 5315. The remainders of paragraphs (39) and (46) are omitted but not repealed, see table III. The parts of paragraphs (39) and (46) that are omitted but not repealed provide that the positions of Director of Selective Service and Associate Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall be in Level III so long as the positions are held by the incumbents of the positions on August 14, 1964. The omission of these provisions from title 5, without repealing the corresponding provisions of the source statute, in effect, leaves existing statute unchanged insofar as it relates to the present incumbents of the positions of Director of Selective Service and Associate Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
