References in TextSection 26, referred to in subsec. (d), probably means section 26 of S. 3378 (act July 22, 1954, ch. 558, 68 Stat. 497) prior to the submission of S. 3378 to the Conference Committee which redesignated section 26 as section 28 of S. 3378. Said section 28 was composed of subsecs. (a) to (d). Subsecs. (a), (c), and (d) thereof enacted sections 1642, 1643, and 1644 of this title, respectively. Subsec. (b) thereof added subsec. (c) to section 3350 of former Title 26, Internal Revenue Code. Reference to section 3350(c) of former Title 26 is deemed a reference to section 7652(b)(3) of Title 26, Internal Revenue Code. See section 7852(b) of Title 26, Internal Revenue Code, which provides that any reference in any other law to a provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 be deemed a reference to the corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
