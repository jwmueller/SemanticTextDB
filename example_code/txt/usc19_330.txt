If in the course of an audit it becomes apparent that additional time will be required, the Customs Service auditor shall immediately provide a further estimate of such additional time.

(2) Before commencing an audit, the Customs Service auditor shall inform the party to be audited of his right to an entry conference at which time the purpose will be explained and an estimated termination date set. Upon completion of on-site audit activities, the Customs Service auditor shall schedule a closing conference to explain the preliminary results of the audit.

(3) Except as provided in paragraph (5), if the estimated or actual termination date for an audit passes without the Customs Service auditor providing a closing conference to explain the results of the audit, the person being audited may petition in writing for such a conference to the officer designated pursuant to regulations, who, upon receipt of such a request, shall provide for such a conference to be held within 15 days after the date of receipt.

(B) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to authorize a refund not otherwise authorized under section 1520 of this title.

The certificate of service signed by the person serving the summons is prima facie evidence of the facts it states on the hearing of an application for the enforcement of the summons. When the summons requires the production of records, such records shall be described in the summons with reasonable specificity.


(d) Special procedures for third-party summonses(1) For purposes of this subsection—(A) The term “records” includes those—(i) required to be kept under section 1508 of this title; or

(ii) regarding which there is probable cause to believe that they pertain to merchandise the importation of which into the United States is prohibited.


(B) The term “summons” means any summons issued under subsection (a) of this section which requires the production of records or the giving of testimony relating to records. Such term does not mean any summons issued to aid in the collection of the liability of any person against whom an assessment has been made or judgment rendered.

(C) The term “third-party recordkeeper” means—(i) any customhouse broker, unless such customhouse broker is the importer of record on an entry;

(iii) any accountant.



(2) If—(A) any summons is served on any person who is a third-party recordkeeper; and

(B) the summons requires the production of, or the giving of testimony relating to, any portion of records made or kept of the transactions described in section 1508 of this title of any person (other than the person summoned) who is identified in the description of the records contained in such summons;


then notice of such summons shall be given to any persons so identified within a reasonable time before the day fixed in the summons as the day upon which such records are to be examined or testimony given. Such notice shall be accompanied by a copy of the summons which has been served and shall contain directions for staying compliance with the summons under paragraph (5)(B) of this subsection.

(3) Any notice required under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be sufficient if such notice is served in the manner provided in subsection (b) of this section upon the person entitled to notice, or is mailed by certified or registered mail to the last known address of such person.

(4) Paragraph (2) of this subsection shall not apply to any summons—(A) served on the person with respect to whose liability for duties, fees, or taxes the summons is issued, or any officer or employee of such person; or

(6) No examination of any records required to be produced under a summons as to which notice is required under paragraph (2) of this subsection may be made—(A) before the expiration of the period allowed for the notice not to comply under paragraph (5)(B) of this subsection, or

(B) if the requirements of such paragraph (5)(B) have been met, except in accordance with an order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction authorizing examination of such records or with the consent of the person staying compliance.


(7) The provisions of paragraphs (2) and (5) of this subsection shall not apply with respect to any summons if, upon petition by the Secretary, the court determines, on the basis of the facts and circumstances alleged, that there is reasonable cause to believe the giving of notice may lead to attempts to conceal, destroy, or alter records relevant to the examination, to prevent the communication of information from other persons through intimidation, bribery, or collusion, or to flee to avoid prosecution, testifying, or production of records.


(e) List of records and informationThe Customs Service shall identify and publish a list of the records or entry information that is required to be maintained and produced under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section.

Participation in the recordkeeping compliance program by recordkeepers is voluntary.


(2) CertificationA recordkeeper may be certified as a participant in the recordkeeping compliance program after meeting the general recordkeeping requirements established under the program or after negotiating an alternative program suited to the needs of the recordkeeper and the Customs Service.

(2) Effects of failure to comply with demandExcept as provided in paragraph (4), if a person fails to comply with a lawful demand for information under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section the following provisions apply:(A) If the failure to comply is a result of the willful failure of the person to maintain, store, or retrieve the demanded information, such person shall be subject to a penalty, for each release of merchandise, not to exceed $100,000, or an amount equal to 75 percent of the appraised value of the merchandise, whichever amount is less.

(ii) if liquidated within the 2-year period preceding the date of the demand, shall be reliquidated, notwithstanding the time limitation in section 1514 or 1520 of this title, at the applicable column 1 general rate of duty;


except that any liquidation or reliquidation under clause (i) or (ii) shall be at the applicable column 2 rate of duty if the Customs Service demonstrates that the merchandise should be dutiable at such rate.


(3) Avoidance of penaltyNo penalty may be assessed under this subsection if the person can show—(A) that the loss of the demanded information was the result of an act of God or other natural casualty or disaster beyond the fault of such person or an agent of the person;

(B) on the basis of other evidence satisfactory to the Customs Service, that the demand was substantially complied with; or

(C) the information demanded was presented to and retained by the Customs Service at the time of entry or submitted in response to an earlier demand.


(4) Penalties not exclusiveAny penalty imposed under this subsection shall be in addition to any other penalty provided by law except for—(A) a penalty imposed under section 1592 of this title for a material omission of the demanded information, or

(ii) is generally in compliance with the appropriate procedures and requirements of the program;


does not produce a demanded record or information for a specific release or provide the information by acceptable alternative means, the Customs Service, in the absence of willfulness or repeated violations, shall issue a written notice of the violation to the recordkeeper in lieu of a monetary penalty. Repeated violations by the recordkeeper may result in the issuance of penalties and removal of certification under the program until corrective action, satisfactory to the Customs Service, is taken.

(B) Contents of noticeA notice of violation issued under subparagraph (A) shall—(i) state that the recordkeeper has violated the recordkeeping requirements;

(ii) indicate the record or information which was demanded; and

(iii) warn the recordkeeper that future failures to produce demanded records or information may result in the imposition of monetary penalties.


(C) Response to noticeWithin a reasonable time after receiving written notice under subparagraph (A), the recordkeeper shall notify the Customs Service of the steps it has taken to prevent a recurrence of the violation.


(D) RegulationsThe Secretary shall promulgate regulations to implement this paragraph. Such regulations may specify the time periods for compliance with a demand for information and provide guidelines which define repeated violations for purposes of this paragraph. Any penalty issued for a recordkeeping violation shall take into account the degree of compliance compared to the total number of importations, the nature of the demanded records and the recordkeeper’s cooperation.
