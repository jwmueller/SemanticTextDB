The words “who has been ordered into active service since April 6, 1917” are omitted as executed. The words “to higher enlisted grades or ratings” are inserted for clarity. The eligibility of retired enlisted men for appointments to warrant and commissioned grades is covered by chapter 539 of this title where the requirements for these appointments are set forth. The words “unless entitled to a higher grade under another provision of law” are inserted to make it clear that retired enlisted members are not precluded by this section from obtaining the benefits of other provisions of law that may give a higher grade to them on their release from active duty.
The provision relating to pay, allowances, and benefits is omitted because it was superseded by §§ 514 and 516 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37 U.S.C. 314 and 316).
