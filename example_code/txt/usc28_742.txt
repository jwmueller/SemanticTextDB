Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 839 (R.S. § 986).
Words “or in the District of Columbia” were added on the authority of 14 Op. Atty. Gen. 384, declaring that, under this section, a writ of execution in favor of the United States, obtained from a Federal court in any State, could be executed in the District of Columbia. (See, also, section 1963 of this title.)
