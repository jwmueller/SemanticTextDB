In subsection (a), the words “members of the Air Force” are substituted for the words “officers and soldiers”.

The word “furnish” is substituted for the words “to afford”, in 10:239. The words “including necessary transportation” are substituted for the last sentence of section 12 of the Act of February 2, 1901, ch. 192, 31 Stat. 750.
