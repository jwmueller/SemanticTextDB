(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 762; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXII, § 320905, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(H), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2126, 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 387 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 237, 35 Stat. 1136).
Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “principal” in section 2 of this title.
Words “in interstate or foreign commerce” were substituted for involved enumeration of places, thus permitting section to be condensed and simplified without change of meaning. See definitive section 10 of this title.
The rewritten punishment provision is in lieu of the following: “for the first offense, be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than two years, or both; and for any subsequent offense shall be imprisoned not more than two years”. There seems no point in fixing a punishment for a second offense less than that for the first offense.
Minor changes were made in phraseology.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $1,000” and inserted “or, being engaged in the business of procuring for a person in 1 State such a ticket, chance, share, or interest in a lottery, gift, enterprise or similar scheme conducted by another State (unless that business is permitted under an agreement between the States in question or appropriate authorities of those States), knowingly transmits in interstate or foreign commerce information to be used for the purpose of procuring such a ticket, chance, share, or interest;” after “scheme;”.
