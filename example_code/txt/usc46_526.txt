In subsection (a), the words “marine terminal operator, or ocean freight forwarder” are added because of 46 App. U.S.C. 1709(d)(3) and (5). The words “ocean freight forwarder” are substituted for “ocean transportation intermediaries, as defined by section 1702(17)(A) of this Appendix” in 46 App. U.S.C. 1709(d)(5) because the definition of “ocean transportation intermediary” in section 1702(17)(A) contains a definition of “ocean freight forwarder” which is restated as a separate definition.
In subsection (b), the words “does not prevent” are substituted for “Nothing . . . shall be construed to prevent” to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsection (c)(1), the words “may give information” are substituted for “Nor shall it be prohibited . . . to give information” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “firm, corporation” are omitted as unnecessary because firms and corporations are persons.
In subsection (c)(2), the words “may not prevent” are substituted for “Nor shall it be prohibited . . . to prevent” to reflect the probable intent of Congress. The words “but the use of such information for any other purpose prohibited by this chapter or any other Act is prohibited” are omitted as unnecessary.
