â€œSec. 4. If any Indian, who leaves any interest in trust or restricted land within the Umatilla Reservation, makes provisions for his or her surviving spouse by an approved will, such surviving spouse shall have an election whether to take the provisions as made in such will or to take the interest as set forth in section 3 of this Act, but such surviving spouse shall not be entitled to both unless it plainly appears by the will to have been so intended by the testator. When any surviving spouse is entitled to an election under this section, he or she shall be deemed to have elected to take the provisions as made in such will unless, at or prior to the first hearing to probate the will, he or she has elected to take under section 3 of this Act and not under the will.
