“(C) Minimum amount.—The amount of a grant provided under subparagraph (A) shall be not less than $250,000.



“(e) Demonstration Projects.—“(1) In general.—Not later than 180 days after the date on which funds are made available to carry out this Act, the Secretary shall establish a program that selects and funds not less than 5 projects proposed by and implemented in collaboration with Federal agencies, units of State and local government, national laboratories, Indian tribes, institutions of higher education, individuals, organizations, or soil and water conservation districts to demonstrate and evaluate the most effective methods of controlling salt cedar and Russian olive trees.

“(2) Project requirements.—The demonstration projects under paragraph (1) shall—“(A) be carried out over a time period and to a scale designed to fully assess long-term management strategies;

“(B) implement salt cedar or Russian olive tree control using 1 or more methods for each project in order to assess the full range of control methods, including—“(i) airborne application of herbicides;

“(ii) mechanical removal; and

“(iii) biocontrol methods, such as the use of goats or insects;


“(C) individually or in conjunction with other demonstration projects, assess the effects of and obstacles to combining multiple control methods and determine optimal combinations of control methods;

“(D) assess soil conditions resulting from salt cedar and Russian olive tree infestation and means to revitalize soils;

“(E) define and implement appropriate final vegetative states and optimal revegetation methods, with preference for self-maintaining vegetative states and native vegetation, and taking into consideration downstream impacts, wildfire potential, and water savings;

“(F) identify methods for preventing the regrowth and reintroduction of salt cedar and Russian olive trees;

“(G) monitor and document any water savings from the control of salt cedar and Russian olive trees, including impacts to both groundwater and surface water;

“(H) assess wildfire activity and management strategies;

“(I) assess changes in wildlife habitat;

“(J) determine conditions under which removal of biomass is appropriate (including optimal methods for the disposal or use of biomass); and
