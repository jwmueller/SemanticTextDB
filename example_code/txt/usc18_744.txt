Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 522 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 322, 35 Stat. 1150).
After the word “Whoever” the following was inserted: “in any Territory or District, or within or upon any place within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States” as based upon the express provisions of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 511, wherein this section is made applicable only “in any Territory or District, or within or upon any place within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.”
Words “whoever shall counsel, aid, abet, or assist in the perpetration of any of the offenses set forth in this section shall be deemed to be a principal therein” were omitted as unnecessary. Such persons are made principals by section 2 of this title.
Minor changes also were made in phraseology.

1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000” in first par.
