§ 3290. Fugitives from justice
No statute of limitations shall extend to any person fleeing from justice.
(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 829.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on Title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 583 (R.S. § 1045).
Said section 583 was rephrased and made applicable to all statutes of limitation and is merely declaratory of the generally accepted rule of law.
