(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 796; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXII, § 320903(a)(2), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2124.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 99 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 46, 35 Stat. 1097).
That portion of said section 99 relating to felonious taking was omitted as covered by section 641 of this title.
The punishment by fine of not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both, was changed to harmonize with section 2111 of this title. The 15–year penalty is not excessive for an offense of this type.
Minor verbal change was made.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 inserted “or attempts to rob” after “robs”.
