“(a) Findings.—Congress makes the following findings:“(1) The Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, done at Paris on January 13, 1993 (commonly referred to as the ‘Chemical Weapons Convention’), requires that destruction of the entire United States chemical weapons stockpile be completed by not later than April 29, 2007.

“(2) In 2006, under the terms of the Chemical Weapons Convention, the United States requested and received a one-time, 5-year extension of its chemical weapons destruction deadline to April 29, 2012.

“(3) On April 10, 2006, the Secretary of Defense notified Congress that the United States would not meet even the extended deadline under the Chemical Weapons Convention for destruction of the United States chemical weapons stockpile, but would ‘continue working diligently to minimize the time to complete destruction without sacrificing safety and security’ and would also ‘continue requesting resources needed to complete destruction as close to April 2012 as practicable’.

“(4) The United States chemical demilitarization program has met its one percent, 20 percent, and extended 45 percent destruction deadlines under the Chemical Weapons Convention.

“(5) Destroying the remaining stockpile of United States chemical weapons is imperative for public safety and homeland security, and doing so by April 2012, in accordance with the current destruction deadline provided under the Chemical Weapons Convention, is required by United States law.

“(6) The elimination of chemical weapons anywhere they exist in the world, and the prevention of their proliferation, is of utmost importance to the national security of the United States.

“(7) Section 921(b)(3) of the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (Public Law 109–364; 120 Stat. 2359) contained a sense of Congress urging the Secretary of Defense to ensure the elimination of the United States chemical weapons stockpile in the shortest time possible, consistent with the requirement to protect public health, safety, and the environment.

“(8) Section 921(b)(4) of that Act contained a sense of Congress urging the Secretary of Defense to propose a credible treatment and disposal process with the support of affected communities. In this regard, any such process should provide for sufficient communication and consultation between representatives of the Department of Defense and representatives of affected States and communities.


“(b) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that—“(1) the United States is, and must remain, committed to making every effort to safely dispose of its entire chemical weapons stockpile by April 2012, the current destruction deadline provided under the Chemical Weapons Convention, or as soon thereafter as possible, and must carry out all of its other obligations under the Convention; and

“(2) the Secretary of Defense should make every effort to plan for, and to request in the annual budget of the President submitted to Congress adequate funding to complete, the elimination of the United States chemical weapons stockpile in accordance with United States obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and in a manner that will protect public health, safety, and the environment, as required by law.
