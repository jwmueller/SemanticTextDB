 49 App.:2311(g).


In this section, the words “Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways” are substituted for “National System of Interstate and Defense Highways” because of the Act of October 15, 1990 (Public Law 101–427, 104 Stat. 927).
In subsection (a), the word “property” is substituted for “cargo” for consistency in the revised title.
Subsection (b)(1) is substituted for 49 App.:2311(a) and (b) (2d–last sentences) to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. Hyphens are used in describing the combinations “truck tractor-semitrailer” and “truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer” for consistency. In clause (D), the word “actually” is omitted as surplus.
Subsection (b)(2) is substituted for 49 App.:2311(b) (1st sentence) because of the restatement.
In subsection (d), the words “such as rear view mirrors, turn signal lamps, marker lamps, steps and handholds for entry and egress, flexible fender extensions, mudflaps and splash and spray suppressant devices, load-induced tire bulge, refrigeration units or air compressors and other devices” are omitted as unnecessary and because most items listed relate to width rather than length.
In subsection (e), the words “by regulation” are added for clarity. The words “subject to the provisions of subsections (a) and (c) of this section” are omitted as surplus. The text of 49 App.:2311(e)(2) and (3) is omitted as executed.
In subsection (f), the word “commercial” is added before “motor vehicle” for consistency.
In subsection (f)(4)(C), the reference to regulations prescribed under subsection (e) is substituted for the reference in the source to regulations issued under subsection (a) to be more precise. The word “amendment” is substituted for “revision” for consistency in the revised title.
Subsection (g) is substituted for 49 App.:2311(d) to eliminate unnecessary words. The Secretary’s general authority to prescribe regulations is provided in 49:322(a). The word “vessel” is substituted for “boat” because of 1:3. The text of 49 App.:2311(g) is omitted as executed.

Amendments2008—Subsec. (a)(4). Pub. L. 110–244, § 301(r)(1), in heading, substituted “Driveaway saddlemount” for “Drive-away saddlemount with fullmount”, and, in text, substituted “driveaway saddlemount” for “drive-away saddlemount with fullmount” and inserted at end “Such combination may include one fullmount.”
Subsec. (b)(1)(D). Pub. L. 110–244, § 301(r)(2), substituted “all driveaway saddlemount” for “a driveaway saddlemount with fullmount”.
