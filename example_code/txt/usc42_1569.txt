(D) for a State with a paternity establishment percentage of not less than 45 percent but less than 50 percent for such fiscal year, the paternity establishment percentage of the State for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus 4 percentage points;

(E) for a State with a paternity establishment percentage of not less than 40 percent but less than 45 percent for such fiscal year, the paternity establishment percentage of the State for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus 5 percentage points; or

(2) For purposes of this section—(A) the term “IV–D paternity establishment percentage” means, with respect to a State for a fiscal year, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) that the total number of children—(i) who have been born out of wedlock,

(ii)(I) except as provided in the last sentence of this paragraph, with respect to whom assistance is being provided under the State program funded under part A of this subchapter in the fiscal year or, at the option of the State, as of the end of such year, or (II) with respect to whom services are being provided under the State’s plan approved under this part in the fiscal year or, at the option of the State, as of the end of such year pursuant to an application submitted under section 654(4)(A)(ii) of this title, and


(iii) the paternity of whom has been established or acknowledged,


bears to the total number of children born out of wedlock and (except as provided in such last sentence) with respect to whom assistance was being provided under the State program funded under part A of this subchapter as of the end of the preceding fiscal year or with respect to whom services were being provided under the State’s plan approved under this part as of the end of the preceding fiscal year pursuant to an application submitted under section 654(4)(A)(ii) of this title;

(B) the term “statewide paternity establishment percentage” means, with respect to a State for a fiscal year, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) that the total number of minor children—(i) who have been born out of wedlock, and

(ii) the paternity of whom has been established or acknowledged during the fiscal year,


bears to the total number of children born out of wedlock during the preceding fiscal year; and

(C) the term “reliable data” means the most recent data available which are found by the Secretary to be reliable for purposes of this section.


For purposes of subparagraphs (A) and (B), the total number of children shall not include any child with respect to whom assistance is being provided under the State program funded under part A of this subchapter by reason of the death of a parent unless paternity is established for such child or any child with respect to whom an applicant or recipient is found by the State to qualify for a good cause or other exception to cooperation pursuant to section 654(29) of this title.

(3)(A) The Secretary may modify the requirements of this subsection to take into account such additional variables as the Secretary identifies (including the percentage of children in a State who are born out of wedlock or for whom support has not been established) that affect the ability of a State to meet the requirements of this subsection.

(B) The Secretary shall submit an annual report to the Congress that sets forth the data upon which the paternity establishment percentages for States for a fiscal year are based, lists any additional variables the Secretary has identified under subparagraph (A), and describes State performance in establishing paternity.

Probably should be “subsection”. for fiscal year 2002, whichever is greater, which shall be available for use by the Secretary, either directly or through grants, contracts, or interagency agreements, for—(1) information dissemination and technical assistance to States, training of State and Federal staff, staffing studies, and related activities needed to improve programs under this part (including technical assistance concerning State automated systems required by this part); and

(2) research, demonstration, and special projects of regional or national significance relating to the operation of State programs under this part.


The amount appropriated under this subsection shall remain available until expended.
