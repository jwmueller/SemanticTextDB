In subsection (b), the word “entity” is substituted for “firm, corporation, partnership, or association” to use a single broad term clarifying that the prohibition applies to any kind of organization in which the person or firm has a substantial interest. The words “containing the name of such persons or firms” are omitted as unnecessary. The word “person” is substituted for “individual” for consistency in the subsection.
