(II) has the authority to require or direct market participants to limit, reduce, or liquidate any position the foreign board of trade (or the foreign futures authority that oversees the foreign board of trade) determines to be necessary to prevent or reduce the threat of price manipulation, excessive speculation as described in section 6a of this title, price distortion, or disruption of delivery or the cash settlement process;

(III) agrees to promptly notify the Commission, with regard to the agreement, contract, or transaction that settles against any price (including the daily or final settlement price) of 1 or more contracts listed for trading on a registered entity, of any change regarding—(aa) the information that the foreign board of trade will make publicly available;

(bb) the position limits that the foreign board of trade or foreign futures authority will adopt and enforce;

(C) Existing foreign boards of tradeSubparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not be effective with respect to any foreign board of trade to which, prior to July 21, 2010, the Commission granted direct access permission until the date that is 180 days after July 21, 2010.
