References in TextSection 460l–9 of this title, referred to in subsec. (b), was in the original “section 8 of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. 460l–9)” which was translated as if it referred to section 7 of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965, to reflect the probable intent of Congress. Section 8 of the Act is classified to section 460l–10 of this title and does not relate to boundaries of National Forests in existence as of January 1, 1965.
