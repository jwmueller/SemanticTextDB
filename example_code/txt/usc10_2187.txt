In subsection (a), the word “commissioned” is inserted for clarity. The words “Except as provided in section 94 of this title”, not contained in section 1169 of the Revised Statutes, but contained in 10:94, are omitted as surplusage, since 10:94 deals exclusively with assignments. The words “except within the Army Medical Service” are substituted for the words “in the line or in other staff corps”. Officers of the Army Nurse Corps and Women’s Medical Specialist Corps are not covered by subsection (a), since their command authority is specifically stated in subsection (b).
In subsection (b), 10:166e (last 22 words of 1st sentence) is omitted as superseded by sections 3012(e) and 3065 of this title. The words “may exercise command only” are substituted for the words “shall not be entitled * * * to command except”.
