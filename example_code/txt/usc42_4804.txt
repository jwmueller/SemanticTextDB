“SEC. 702. FINDINGS.“Congress finds that—“(1) oilheat fuel is an important commodity relied on by approximately 30,000,000 Americans as an efficient and economical energy source for commercial and residential space and hot water heating;

“(2) oilheat fuel equipment operates at efficiencies among the highest of any space heating energy source, reducing fuel costs and making oilheat fuel an economical means of space heating;

“(3) the production, distribution, and marketing of oilheat fuel and oilheat fuel equipment plays a significant role in the economy of the United States, accounting for approximately $12,900,000,000 in expenditures annually and employing millions of Americans in all aspects of the oilheat fuel industry;

“(4) only very limited Federal resources have been made available for oilheat fuel research, development, safety, training, and education efforts, to the detriment of both the oilheat fuel industry and its 30,000,000 consumers;

“(5) the cooperative development, self-financing, and implementation of a coordinated national oilheat fuel industry program of research and development, training, and consumer education is necessary and important for the welfare of the oilheat fuel industry, the general economy of the United States, and the millions of Americans that rely on oilheat fuel for commercial and residential space and hot water heating;

“(6) consumers of oilheat fuel fuel [sic] are provided service by thousands of small businesses that are unable to individually develop training programs to facilitate the entry of new and qualified workers into the oilheat fuel fuel [sic] industry;

“(7) small businesses and trained employees are in an ideal position—“(A) to provide information to consumers about the benefits of improved efficiency; and

“(B) to encourage consumers to value efficiency in energy choices and assist individuals in conserving energy;


“(8) additional research is necessary—“(A) to improve oilheat fuel fuel [sic] equipment; and

“(B) to develop domestic renewable resources that can be used to safely and affordably heat homes;


“(9) since there are no Federal resources available to assist the oilheat fuel fuel [sic] industry, it is necessary and appropriate to develop a self-funded program dedicated—“(A) to improving efficiency in customer homes;

“(B) to assist individuals to gain employment in the oilheat fuel fuel [sic] industry; and

“(C) to develop domestic renewable resources;


“(10) both consumers of oilheat fuel fuel [sic] and retailers would benefit from the self-funded program; and

“(11) the oilheat fuel fuel [sic] industry is committed to providing appropriate funding necessary to carry out the purposes of this title without passing additional costs on to residential consumers.
