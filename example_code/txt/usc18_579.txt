§ 1545. Safe conduct violation
Whoever violates any safe conduct or passport duly obtained and issued under authority of the United States shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.
(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 771; Pub. L. 103–322, title XIII, § 130009(a)(3), title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(I), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2030, 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 251 of title 22, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Foreign Relations and Intercourse (R.S. 4062).
The punishment provision was rewritten to permit the alternative of a fine of not more than $2,000 or imprisonment, or both, instead of imprisonment and fine “at the discretion of the court”, to conform with other sections embracing offenses of comparable gravity.
Minor changes were made in phraseology.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322, § 330016(1)(I), which directed the amendment of this section by substituting “under this title” for “not more than $2,000”, could not be executed because the words “not more than $2,000” did not appear in text subsequent to amendment by Pub. L. 103–322, § 130009(a)(3). See below.
Pub. L. 103–322, § 130009(a)(3), substituted “under this title, imprisoned not more than 10 years” for “not more than $2,000 or imprisoned not more than three years”.
