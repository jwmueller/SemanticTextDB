Codification
Section is derived from the second paragraph of section 1 of the Resolution of June 11, 1906. The second paragraph, aforesaid, originally began with the following words omitted here “The south and west boundary lines of the Yosemite National Park are hereby changed as follows:” The first portion of this section before the colon was derived from a later portion of the original section reading as follows: “And all that portion of the Yosemite National Park lying between the boundary line last above mentioned and the present boundary line of said national park is excluded from said park; and the said lands so excluded, and all thereof, are added to and made a part of the Sierra Forest Reserve, and shall hereafter form a part of said Sierra Forest Reserve, and shall be subject to all of the Acts of Congress with relation thereto:” The words of the first sentence of this section “described in section 46 of this title” replace the words “present boundary line” hereinbefore quoted.
For the first paragraph of the Resolution of June 11, 1906, see section 48 of this title.
“Sierra National Forest” substituted in text for “Sierra Forest Reserve” on authority of act Mar. 4, 1907, ch. 2907, 34 Stat. 1269, which provided that forest reserves shall hereafter be known as national forests.
