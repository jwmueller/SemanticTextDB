(c)5 U.S.C. 944(d) (less last 27 words).June 30, 1945, ch. 212, § 604(e) (less last 27 words), 59 Stat. 304.


In subsection (a), the words “in the departmental and the field services” are omitted as unnecessary.
In subsections (a) and (b), the words “an Executive agency, a military department” are coextensive with and substituted for “the several departments and independent establishments and agencies in the executive branch, including Government-owned or controlled corporations” and “such department, establishment, or agency” in view of the definitions in sections 105 and 102. The words “a military department” are included to preserve the application of the source law. Before enactment of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 578), the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force were Executive departments. The National Security Act Amendments of 1949 established the Department of Defense as an Executive Department including the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force as military departments, not as Executive departments. However, the source law for this section which was in effect in 1949, remained applicable to the Secretaries of the military departments by virtue of section 12(g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 591), which is set out in the reviser’s note for section 301.
Subsection (d) is added on authority of former sections 901(d) and 2358(a) (as applicable to the Federal Employees Pay Act of 1945, as amended) which are carried into section 5541, and to include individuals employed by the government of the District of Columbia as they are not included in the definition of “employee” in section 2105.
Subsection (e) is added on authority of former section 945, which is carried into section 5548. The words “an Executive agency” are substituted for “the executive branch of the Government” to conform to the definition in section 105. Applicability of this section to employees of the General Accounting Office is based on former section 933a.
Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
