§ 1715z–6. Supplemental loans for multifamily projects(a) Authorization to insure; “supplemental loan” definedWith respect to a multifamily project, hospital, or group practice facility covered by a mortgage insured under any section or subchapter of this chapter or covered by a mortgage held by the Secretary, the Secretary is authorized, upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, to make commitments to insure, and to insure, supplemental loans (including advances during construction or improvement) made by financial institutions approved by the Secretary. As used in this section, “supplemental loan” means a loan, advance of credit, or purchase of an obligation representing a loan or advance of credit made for the purpose of financing improvements or additions to such proj­ect, hospital, or facility: Provided, That a loan involving a nursing home, hospital, or a group practice facility may also be made for the purpose of financing equipment to be used in the operation of such nursing home, hospital, or facility.


(b) Eligibility for insuranceTo be eligible for insurance under this section, a supplemental loan shall—(1) be limited to 90 per centum of the amount which the Secretary estimates will be the value of such improvements, additions, and equipment, except that such amount when added to the outstanding balance of the mortgage covering the project or facility, shall not exceed the maximum mortgage amount insurable under the section or subchapter pursuant to which the mortgage covering such project or facility is insured or an amount acceptable to the Secretary;

(2) have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary;

(3) bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the borrower and the financial institution;

(4) be secured in such manner as the Secretary may require;

(5) be governed by the labor standards provisions of section 1715c of this title that are applicable to the section or subchapter pursuant to which the mortgage covering the proj­ect or facility is insured or pursuant to which the original mortgage covering the project or facility was insured; and

(6) contain such other terms, conditions, and restrictions as the Secretary may prescribe.


(c) Applicability of other provisions of lawThe provisions of subsections (d), (e), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l), and (n) of section 1713 of this title shall be applicable to loans insured under this section, except that (1) all references to the term “mortgage” shall be construed to refer to the term “loan” as used in this section, (2) loans involving projects covered by a mortgage insured under section 1715e of this title that is the obligation of the Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund shall be insured under and shall be the obligation of such fund, and (3) loans involving projects covered by a mortgage insured under section 1715z–1 of this title shall be insured under and shall be the obligation of the Special Risk Insurance Fund.


(d) Authorization to insure loans for improvements or additions; terms and conditions; limitation on amountNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Secretary may insure a loan for improvements or additions to a multifamily housing project, or a group practice or medical practice facility or hospital or other health facility approved by the Secretary, which is not covered by a mortgage insured under this chapter, if he finds that such a loan would assist in preserving, expanding, or improving housing opportunities, or in providing protection against fire or other hazards. Such loans shall have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary and shall meet such other conditions as the Secretary may prescribe. In no event shall such a loan be insured if it is for an amount in excess of the maximum amount which could be approved if the outstanding indebtedness, if any, covering the property were a mortgage insured under this chapter. At any sale under foreclosure of a mortgage on a project or facility which is not insured under this chapter but which is senior to a loan assigned to the Secretary pursuant to subsection (c), the Secretary is authorized to bid, in addition to amounts authorized under section 1713(k) of this title, any sum up to but not in excess of the total unpaid indebtedness secured by such senior mortgage, plus taxes, insurance, foreclosure costs, fees, and other expenses. In the event that, pursuant to subsection (c), the Secretary acquires title to, or is assigned, a loan covering a project or facility which is subject to a mortgage which is not insured under this chapter, the Secretary is authorized to make payments from the General Insurance Fund on the debt secured by such mortgage, and to take such other steps as the Secretary may deem appropriate to preserve or protect the Secretary’s interest in the project or facility.


(e) Loan insurance for energy conserving improvements and solar energy systems(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary may insure a loan for purchasing and installing energy conserving improvements (as defined in subparagraph (2) of the last paragraph of section 1703(a) of this title), for purchasing and installing a solar energy system (as defined in subparagraph (3) of the last paragraph of section 1703(a) of this title), and for purchasing or installing (or both) individual utility meters in a multifamily housing project if such meters are purchased or installed in connection with other energy conserving improvements or with a solar energy system or the project meets minimum standards of energy conservation established by the Secretary, without regard to whether the proj­ect is covered by a mortgage under this chapter.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b), a loan insured under this subsection shall—(A) not exceed an amount which the Secretary determines is necessary for the purchase and installation of individual utility meters plus an amount which the Secretary deems appropriate taking into account amounts which will be saved in operation costs over the period of repayment of the loan by reducing the energy requirements of the project as a result of the installation of energy conserving improvements or a solar energy system therein;

(B) be insured for 90 percent of any loss incurred by the person holding the note for the loan; except that, for cooperative multifamily projects receiving assistance under section 1715z–1 of this title or financed with a below market interest rate mortgage insured under section 1715l(d)(3) of this title, 100 percent of any such loss may be insured;
