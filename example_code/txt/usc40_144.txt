The words “On and after May 30, 1908” are omitted as obsolete. The words “Administrator of General Services” are substituted for “Secretary of the Treasury” [subsequently changed to “Federal Works Administrator” because of section 303 of Reorganization Plan No. I of 1939 (eff. July 1, 1939, 53 Stat. 1427)] because of section 103(a) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, 63 Stat. 380), which is restated as section 303(c) [303(b)] of the revised title.
