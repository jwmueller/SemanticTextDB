Codification
R.S. § 5240 derived from act June 3, 1864, ch. 106, § 54, 13 Stat. 116, which was part of the National Bank Act. See section 38 of this title.
Section is comprised of sixth par. of R.S. § 5240, as amended. See Codification note set out under section 481 of this title.
Section 412 of Pub. L. 97–320, set out in the credit of this section, was amended by section 23(a) of Pub. L. 97–457 to correct an error in the directory language of section 412 of Pub. L. 97–320. That amendment involved only directory language and not the content of the text being amended by Pub. L. 97–320 so no change in the text of this section resulted from the amendment by Pub. L. 97–457.

Amendments1982—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 97–320, as amended by Pub. L. 97–457, designated existing provisions as subsec. (a), and amended subsec. (a) generally. Prior to amendment subsec.

Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 97–320, as amended by Pub. L. 97–457, added subsec. (b).

Effective Date of 1983 AmendmentPub. L. 97–457, § 23(b), Jan. 12, 1983, 96 Stat. 2510, provided that: “The amendment made by subsection (a) [amending section 412 of Pub.
