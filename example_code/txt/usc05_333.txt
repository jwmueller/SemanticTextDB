In subsection (a), the words “reduction in force” are substituted for “reduction in personnel”. The words “in any civilian service of any Federal agency” are omitted as unnecessary because of the application stated in section 3501. In the second sentence, the word “total” in the phrase “length of service” is omitted for consistency with paragraph (3), and the words “subject to subsection (c) of this section” are omitted as unnecessary in view of the supplied distinction between a competing employee who is not a retired member of a uniformed service and such an employee who is a retired member of a uniformed service. In paragraph (A), the words “total length of time in active service” are substituted for “length of time spent in active service” for consistency with paragraph (B)(ii).
In subsections (a) and (b), the references to “performance” ratings and ratings of “satisfactory” are added on authority of former section 2005, which is carried into section 4304.
Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
