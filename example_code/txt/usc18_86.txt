Historical and Revision NotesBased on sections 595, 1125, and 1315 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking (Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, § 22, first sentence of second paragraph, 38 Stat. 272; July 17, 1916, ch. 245, § 211(e), as added Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, § 2, 42 Stat. 1460; June 21, 1917, ch. 32, § 11, 40 Stat. 240; Sept. 26, 1918, ch. 177, § 5, part 22(c), 40 Stat. 970; Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, title II, § 216(e), 42 Stat. 1472).
The punishment provisions of the three sections were identical, and all other provisions thereof were similar, except that section 595 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, relating to officers, directors, employees, or attorneys of member banks of the Federal Reserve System, did not include the terms “agent” and “acceptance” and did not include the phrase “or extension or renewal of loan or substitution of security”.
Words “shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor” were omitted because of definition of misdemeanor in section 1 of this title.
Words “and upon conviction” and “and shall upon conviction thereof” were omitted as surplusage because punishment cannot be imposed until after conviction.
Verbal changes were made for style purposes.
