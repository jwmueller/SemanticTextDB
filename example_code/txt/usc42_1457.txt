“Where—“(1) one or more persons were entitled (without the application of section 202(j)(1) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 402(j)(1)]) to monthly benefits under section 202 of such Act for the month in which this Act is enacted [August 1958] on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of an individual; and

“(2) a person is entitled to a parent’s insurance benefit under section 202(h) of the Social Security Act for any subsequent month on the basis of such wages and self-employment income and such person would not be entitled to such benefit but for the enactment of this section; and

“(3) the total of the benefits to which all persons are entitled under section 202 of the Social Security Act on the basis of such wages and self-employment income for such subsequent month are reduced by reason of the application of section 203(a) of such Act [42 U.S.C. 403(a)].


then the amount of the benefit to which each such person referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection is entitled for such subsequent month shall be increased, after the application of such section 203(a), to the amount it would have been if no person referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection was entitled to a parent’s insurance benefit for such subsequent month on the basis of such wages and self-employment income.”
