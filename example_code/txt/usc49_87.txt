In subsection (a), before clause (1), the word “officer” is added for consistency in the revised title.
In subsection (b)(1), the words “investigating an aircraft accident” are substituted for “carrying out its duties” in 49 App.:1441(c) for clarity. The words “inspect and test” are substituted for “examine and test” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.
In subsection (c), before clause (1), the words “In carrying out subsection (a)(1) of this section, an officer or employee” are added because of the restatement. The words “or any part of any such item” are omitted as surplus. The words “when such examination or testing is determined to be required for purposes of such investigation” are omitted as unnecessary because of the words “do anything necessary to conduct an investigation” in subsection (a)(1) of this section.

In subsection (d), the word “individuals” is substituted for “persons” the 2d time that word is used for clarity. The words “The Board shall make any of those decisions” are substituted for “and shall be made” because of the restatement.
In subsection (e), the word “promptly” is substituted for “with reasonable promptness” to eliminate unnecessary words.
