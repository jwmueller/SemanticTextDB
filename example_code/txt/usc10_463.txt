In subsections (a), (b), (d), (f), (g), (h), (i), and (j), the rules stated in the corresponding clauses of the first proviso of the first paragraph, and the last proviso of the last paragraph, of 10:1393, are restated to make positive the authority of the persons described in those subsections to wear the uniform prescribed for the appropriate organization or activity.
In subsection (c), the words “bear the title”, in 34:43g(i), applicable only to retired officers of the Navy Nurse Corps, are made applicable to other retired officers, to make explicit what has heretofore been implicit, that a retired officer may continue to bear the title of his retired grade.
In subsection (e), the words between the second and third semicolons of the first proviso of the first paragraph of 10:1393 are omitted as superseded by 10:1028b and 34:399d, which authorize the wearing of the uniform by members who are discharged honorably or under honorable conditions. The words “when authorized by regulations prescribed by” are substituted for the words “occasions authorized by regulations of”.
In subsection (f), the words “while portraying a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps, an actor in a theatrical or motion-picture production” are substituted for the words “any person from wearing the uniform of the United States Army, Navy, or Marine Corps, in any playhouse or theater or in moving-picture films while actually engaged in representing therein a military or naval character”.
In subsection (g), the word “resident” is substituted for the word “members”, since the word “members” related to members of the now disbanded National Home for disabled volunteer soldiers to which were admitted “members” of an organization called the “Disabled Volunteer Soldiers”. The words “veterans’ home” are substituted for the words “national home for veterans”, since there are now no “national homes” administered by the Veterans’ Administration.
In subsection (h), the words “authorized and” and “for wear during such course of instruction” are omitted as surplusage. The word “naval” is omitted as covered by the word “military”. The words “Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps” are substituted for the words “military or naval authorities”. The words “that armed force” are substituted for the words “such military or naval authorities”.
In subsection (i), the words “Air Force school” are substituted for the words “Air Force advanced flying schools or Air Force service schools”. The words “in such manner” are omitted as surplusage.
