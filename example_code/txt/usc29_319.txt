“(C) such other factors as the working group determines to be appropriate.


“(5) Information campaign.—Upon completion of development of the best practices under subsection (a)(3), the National Council on Disability, in consultation with the working group, shall conduct an informational and educational campaign designed to inform individuals with disabilities, pharmacists, and the public about such best practices.

“(6) FACA waiver.—The Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.) shall not apply to the working group.


“(b) GAO Study.—“(1) In general.—Beginning 18 months after the completion of the development of best practices under subsection (a)(3)(A), the Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct a review of the extent to which pharmacies are utilizing such best practices, and the extent to which barriers to accessible information on prescription drug container labels for blind and visually impaired individuals continue.

“(2) Report.—Not later than September 30, 2016, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to Congress a report on the review conducted under paragraph (1). Such report shall include recommendations about how best to reduce the barriers experienced by blind and visually impaired individuals to independently accessing information on prescription drug container labels.
