In this section, the words “consular officer” are substituted for “Consuls and vice consuls” and “consul or vice consul” for consistency in the revised title.
Subsection (a)(1) is substituted for “as well for the purpose of saving the vessels, their cargoes and appurtenances, as for storing and securing the effects and merchandise saved” to eliminate unnecessary words.
