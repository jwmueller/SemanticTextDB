In addition to the usual number of the report of the Geological Survey, ten thousand copies shall be printed: two thousand for the Senate, four thousand for the House of Representatives, four thousand for distribution by the Geological Survey.
The reports of the Geological Survey, except the annual report of the Director, shall be published in editions recommended in each case by the Director and approved by the Secretary of the Interior, but not to exceed ten thousand copies.
When the edition of a report of the Survey is exhausted, and the demand for it continues, there may be published, on the requisition of the Secretary of the Interior, as many additional copies of the report as the Director of the Survey states will, in his judgment, be necessary to meet the demand.
The report of the mineral resources of the United States shall be published in two octavo volumes and as a distinct publication, the number of copies, printing of separate chapters, and mode of distribution of which shall be the same as of the annual report.
Three thousand copies of the monographs and bulletins of the Geological Survey shall be published.
The bulletins and professional papers shall be distributed gratuitously and of the number published one thousand copies shall be delivered to the Senate and two thousand copies to the House of Representatives, for distribution.
The Director of the Geological Survey shall transmit to the Library of Congress two copies of every report of the bureau as soon as the first delivery to the Survey is made, in addition to those received by the Library of Congress under any other law.
