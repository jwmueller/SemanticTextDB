“(2) Procedure for use of calculation.—If the Secretary decides to use the calculation described in subsection (a) as provided under paragraph (1), in the case of a producer of 1988 or 1989 crop barley who paid the refund of the advance deficiency payment for the crop calculated prior to the date of enactment of this Act (or any amount of refund in excess of the amount of the refund determined in accordance with paragraph (1)), the Secretary—“(i) shall, before May 31, 1991, reimburse the producer the amount of refund paid by the producer in excess of the refund determined in accordance with this section;

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.); and

“(D) the total quantity of the 1988 or 1989 crop of the commodity that the producers were able to harvest is less than the result of multiplying 65 percent of the farm payment yield established by the Secretary for the crop by the sum of the acreage planted for the harvest and the acreage prevented from being planted (because of the disaster or emergency referred to in subparagraph (C)) for the crop.”
