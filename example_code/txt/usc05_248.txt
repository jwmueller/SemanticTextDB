§ 3302. Competitive service; rules
The President may prescribe rules governing the competitive service. The rules shall provide, as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant, for—(1) necessary exceptions of positions from the competitive service; and

(2) necessary exceptions from the provisions of sections 2951, 3304(a), 3321, 7202, and 7203 of this title.


Each officer and individual employed in an agency to which the rules apply shall aid in carrying out the rules.

The reference to the competitive service is substituted for the reference to the Act creating that service. The reference to reasons for the exceptions is omitted as covered by section 1308 of this title. The words “provide for” are substituted for “provide and declare”. Paragraph (1) is supplied to preserve the President’s power to except positions from the competitive service, previously implied from the power to except from the first rule in former section 633(2). Authority to make exceptions to so much of former section 633(2) as is restated in this section and section 1302(a) is omitted as meaningless. Authority to make exceptions to so much of former section 633(2) as is restated in section 3318(a) is omitted as superseded by former section 857, which is carried into section 3318(a). In the last sentence, the words “Each officer and individual employed in an agency” are substituted for “officers of the United States in the departments and offices” because of the restrictive definition of “officer” in section 2104.
Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.

Amendments1993—Par. (2). Pub. L. 103–94 substituted “and 7203” for “7203, 7321, and 7322”.
1979—Par. (2). Pub. L. 96–54 amended par. (2) in same manner as amendment by section 703(c)(1) of Pub. L. 95–454. See 1978 Amendment note below.
1978—Par. (2). Pub. L. 95–454 substituted “7202, 7203” for “7152, 7153”.
Pub. L. 95–228 struck out reference to section 3306(a)(1) of this title. Amendments by section 703(c)(1) and (c)(2) of Pub. L. 95–454 appear to have been inadvertently reversed. Subsec. (c)(1) purported to amend subsec. (c)(1) of section 2105 of this title, and subsec. (c)(2) purported to amend par. (2) of this section. However, the amendments specified by Pub. L. 95–454, § 703(c)(1) and (2), were impossible to execute literally. Thus, amendment by Pub. L. 95–454, § 703(c)(2) was executed to section 2105 of this title, and amendment by section 703(c)(1) was executed to this section as the probable intent of Congress.

NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution of the United States, by sections 3301 and 3302 of title 5, United States Code, and as President of the United States, it is ordered as follows:

(a) A person eligible for appointment under section 1 of this order may be appointed only within one year after his separation from the armed forces, or one year following his release from hospitalization or treatment immediately following his separation from the armed forces, or one year after involuntary separation without cause from (i) a veterans readjustment appointment or (ii) a transitional appointment, or one year after the effective date of this order if he is serving under a transitional appointment.
(b) The Office of Personnel Management may determine the circumstances under which service under a transitional appointment may be deemed service under a veterans readjustment appointment for the purpose of paragraph (f) of section 1 of this order.
Sec. 3. Any law, Executive order, or regulation which would disqualify an applicant for appointment in the competitive service shall also disqualify a person otherwise eligible for appointment under section 1 of this order.
Sec. 4. For the purpose of this order:
(a) “agency” means a military department as defined in section 102 of title 5, United States Code, an executive agency (other than the General Accounting Office [now Government Accountability Office]) as defined in section 105 of title 5, United States Code, and those portions of the legislative and judicial branches of the Federal Government and of the government of the District of Columbia having positions in the competitive service; and
(b) “Vietnam era” means the period beginning August 5, 1964, and ending on such date thereafter as may be determined by Presidential proclamation or concurrent resolution of the Congress.
Sec. 5. The Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this order.
