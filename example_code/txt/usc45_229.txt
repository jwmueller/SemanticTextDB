§ 901. Congressional findings(a) Congress hereby finds that—(1) the severe operating losses and the deteriorating plant and equipment of the Milwaukee Railroad threaten to cause cessation of its operations in the near future;

(2) a cessation of operations by the Milwaukee Railroad would have serious repercussions on the economies of the States in which such railroad principally operates (the States of Washington, Montana, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Michigan, Indiana, Minnesota, and Wisconsin);

(3) a cessation of operations of the Milwaukee Railroad would result in the loss of many thousands of jobs of railroad workers and other workers whose employment is dependent upon rail service over the lines presently operated by the Milwaukee Railroad;

(4) experienced railroad employees make a valuable contribution toward strengthening the railroad industry; and other railroads have the ability and willingness to employ displaced employees of the Milwaukee Railroad;

(5) the ownership by employees or by employees and shippers of part or all of the Milwaukee Railroad may be a valuable tool in reorganization and should be given serious consideration;

(6) cessation of essential transportation services by the Milwaukee Railroad would endanger the public welfare;

(7) cessation of such services is imminent; and

(8) there is no other practicable means of obtaining funds to meet payroll and other expenses necessary for continuation of services and reorganization of the Milwaukee Railroad.


(b) The Congress declares that emergency measures set forth in this chapter must be taken to restructure the Milwaukee Railroad and to avoid the potential unemployment and damage to the economy of the region and of the Nation which a cessation of essential services by the Milwaukee Railroad would otherwise cause.

Statement of PurposePub. L. 97–468, title II, subtitle A, § 211, Jan. 14, 1983, 96 Stat. 2543, provided that: “It is the purpose of this subtitle [amending sections 915 and 1017 of this title and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section] to continue the effort by Congress to assure service over the lines of rail carriers subject to liquidation in instances where rail carriers are willing to provide service over such lines and financially responsible persons are willing to purchase the lines for continued rail operations.”


Congressional FindingsPub. L. 97–468, title II, § 212, Jan. 14, 1983, 96 Stat. 2543, provided that: 
“The Congress finds that—
“(1) it is necessary to establish procedures to facilitate and expedite the acquisition of rail lines of carriers subject to liquidation by financially responsible persons in instances where service is not being provided over the line by the carrier and where the financially responsible person seeks to provide rail service over the line;

“(2) procedures set forth in the amendments made by this title [see Short Title of 1983 Amendment note above] represent an exercise of the powers of the Congress under the Constitution to regulate commerce among the several States which will provide a practicable means for preserving rail service, thus benefiting shippers, employees, and the economies of the States in which such carriers subject to liquidation have operated service, and for facilitating interstate commerce, while at the same time providing safeguards to protect the interest of the estates of such carriers by requiring compensation which is not less than the constitutionally required minimum; and

“(3) it is in the public interest that the Interstate Commerce Commission’s authority to issue orders involving temporary authority to operate service over lines of carriers subject to liquidation be clarified.”
