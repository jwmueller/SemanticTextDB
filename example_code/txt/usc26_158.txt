Codification
Pub. L. 109–135, title IV, § 403(ee)(1), (nn), Dec. 21, 2005, 119 Stat. 2631, 2632, which directed that subsec. (d) of this section be amended by redesignating the paragraph (10) relating to property acquired from a decedent as paragraph (11), effective as if included in the provisions to which such amendment relates of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, Pub. L. 108–357, was executed as the probable intent of Congress by redesignating as paragraph (11) the paragraph (10) directed to be added to subsec. (d) of this section by Pub. L. 107–16, § 542(c), (f)(1), applicable to estates of decedents dying after Dec. 31, 2009.

Pub. L. 108–121, title I, § 101(a), (b)(1), Nov. 11, 2003, 117 Stat. 1336, which directed that subsec.

L. 105–34, could not literally be executed insofar as it directed the redesignation because subsec. (d), as amended by Pub. L. 105–34, did not contain a paragraph (9).
