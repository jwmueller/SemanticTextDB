The word “subtreasuries” in the 6th complete paragraph on p. 614 of section 1 of the Act of July 1, 1898 (ch. 546, 30 Stat. 614), is omitted because section 1 (words in par. under heading “Independent Treasury”) of the Act of May 29, 1914 (ch. 214, 41 Stat. 654) discontinued subtreasuries. The word “post-offices” in section 1 is omitted because section 1 of Executive Order No. 6166 (eff. June 10, 1933) transferred administration of post office buildings to the Post Office Department. The words “courthouses, customhouses, appraiser’s stores, barge offices, and other” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “or are in course of construction” are omitted as obsolete. The words “Administrator of General Services” are substituted for “Treasury Department” and “Secretary of the Treasury” [subsequently changed to “Federal Works Agency” and “Federal Works Administrator” because of sections 301 and 303, respectively, of Reorganization Plan No. I of 1939 (eff. July 1, 1939, 53 Stat. 1426, 1427)] because of section 103(a) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, 63 Stat. 380), which is restated as section 303(c) [303(b)] of the revised title.
