“(3) less than 3,000 tribal and Federal law enforcement officers patrol more than 56,000,000 acres of Indian country, which reflects less than ½ of the law enforcement presence in comparable rural communities nationwide;

“(4) the complicated jurisdictional scheme that exists in Indian country—“(A) has a significant negative impact on the ability to provide public safety to Indian communities;

“(6) Indian tribes have faced significant increases in instances of domestic violence, burglary, assault, and child abuse as a direct result of increased methamphetamine use on Indian reservations; and

“(b) Purposes.—The purposes of this title [see Short Title of 2010 Amendment note above] are—“(1) to clarify the responsibilities of Federal, State, tribal, and local governments with respect to crimes committed in Indian country;
