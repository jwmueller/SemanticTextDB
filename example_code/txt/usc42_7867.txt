(2) Selection criteriaNot later than 12 months after December 19, 2007, the Secretary shall establish criteria for evaluating applications for grants under this subsection that will maximize the availability and use of renewable fuel blends, and that will ensure that renewable fuel blends are available across the country. Such criteria shall provide for—(A) consideration of the public demand for each renewable fuel blend in a particular geographic area based on State registration records showing the number of flexible-fuel vehicles;

(B) consideration of the opportunity to create or expand corridors of renewable fuel blend stations along interstate or State highways;

(C) consideration of the experience of each applicant with previous, similar projects;

(D) consideration of population, number of flexible-fuel vehicles, number of retail fuel outlets, and saturation of flexible-fuel vehicles; and

(2) help in identifying supply sources and securing long-term contracts; and

(3) provision of public outreach, education, and labeling materials.


(d) Refueling infrastructure corridors(1) In generalThe Secretary shall establish a competitive grant pilot program (referred to in this subsection as the “pilot program”), to be administered through the Vehicle Technology Deployment Program of the Department, to provide not more than 10 geographically-dispersed project grants to State governments, Indian tribal governments, local governments, metropolitan transportation authorities, or partnerships of those entities to carry out 1 or more projects for the purposes described in paragraph (2).
