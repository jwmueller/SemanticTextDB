630241:11a.June 30, 1921, ch. 33, § 1 (last proviso on p. 78), 42 Stat. 78.


The words “Secretary of the Army” are substituted for “Secretary of War” because of section 205(a) of the National Security Act of 1947 (ch. 343, 61 Stat. 501). Section 205(a) was repealed by section 53 of the Act of August 10, 1956 (ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 676). Section 1 of the Act of August 10, 1956 (70A Stat. 1) enacted Title 10, “Armed Forces”, and under sections 3011 to 3013 of title 10, the Department of the Army remains under the administrative supervision of the Secretary of the Army.
