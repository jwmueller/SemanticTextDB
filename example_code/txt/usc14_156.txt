(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 520; Pub. L. 98–557, § 15(a)(3)(C), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2865.)

Historical and Revision NotesDerived from title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 23 (Apr. 16, 1908, ch. 145, § 8, 35 Stat. 62).
Inasmuch as all phases of promotion of enlisted men, except the points covered by title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 23, have been left to administrative control heretofore, and this has proved most satisfactory, the entire promotion of enlisted men is delegated to administrative control by this section. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

Amendments1984—Pub. L. 98–557 substituted “Enlisted members” for “Enlisted men”.
