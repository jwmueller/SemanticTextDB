“Where—“(1) two or more persons are entitled to monthly benefits under section 202 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 402] for December 1972 on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of a deceased individual, and one or more of such persons is so entitled under subsection (e) or (f) of such section 202, and

“(2) one or more of such persons is entitled on the basis of such wages and self-employment income to monthly benefits under subsection (e) or (f) of such section 202 (as amended by this section) for January 1973, and

“(3) the total of benefits to which all persons are entitled under section 202 of such Act on the basis of such wages and self-employment income for January 1973 is reduced by reason of section 203(a) of such Act [42 U.S.C. 403(a)], as amended by this Act (or would, but for the penultimate sentence of such section 203(a), be so reduced),


then the amount of the benefit to which each such person referred to in paragraph (1) is entitled for months after December 1972 shall in no case be less after the application of this section and such section 203(a) than the amount it would have been without the application of this section.”
