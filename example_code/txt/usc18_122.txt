Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 83 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 35, 35 Stat. 1095; Oct. 23, 1918, ch. 194, 40 Stat. 1015; June 18, 1934, ch. 587, 48 Stat. 996; Apr. 4, 1938, ch. 69, 52 Stat. 197).
To clarify meaning of “department” the word “agency” was inserted after it. (See definitions of “department” and “agency” in section 6 of this title.)
Words “or any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder” were omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “agency” in section 6 of this title.
Minor changes in phraseology were made.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $10,000”.
