The Bureau is continued as an agency within, and under the jurisdiction of, the Department of Commerce.
(Aug. 31, 1954, ch. 1158, 68 Stat. 1012.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., § 1 (Mar. 6, 1902, ch. 139, § 1, 32 Stat. 51; Feb. 14, 1903, ch. 552, § 4, 32 Stat. 826; Mar. 4, 1913, ch. 141, § 1, 37 Stat. 736; June 18, 1929, ch. 28, § 21, 46 Stat. 26).
Section 1 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., provided that the “Census Office” temporarily established in the Department of the Interior in accordance with the act of Mar. 3, 1899 (ch. 419, 30 Stat. 1014) “is made” a permanent office in the Department of Commerce. Such wording is no longer necessary, and the provisions, as revised in this section, merely continue the Bureau (of the Census) as an agency within, and under the jurisdiction of, the Department of Commerce.
