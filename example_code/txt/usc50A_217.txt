“The business of this Court having been completed, it is ordered that at the expiration of 30 days from this date, if a petition for certiorari has not been filed in the Supreme Court in Case No. 676 [Rosenzweig v. General Services Administration], just decided, the acting clerk shall deliver the records and papers of the Court in his office to the General Services Administration for permanent custody as records of the Government, and shall thereupon inform the Chief Justice of the United States that the work of the Court has been completed and that the designations of the judges of the Court may therefore appropriately be terminated.
“If a petition for certiorari is filed in Case No. 676 this order shall take effect and be carried out at the expiration of 30 days after the final disposition of Case No. 676.”
