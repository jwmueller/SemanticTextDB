In subsection (a), the words “Seeing-eye dogs or other” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “or other service animals” are added, and the words “individuals with disabilities” are substituted for “blind masters”, because of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and Part 39 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which expanded the coverage of the source provision to all service animals and to all individuals with disabilities.
