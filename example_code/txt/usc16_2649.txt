§ 539l–4. Other administrative provisions(a) Buffer zonesThe designation by this Act or by amendments made by this Act of wilderness areas and the Protection Area in the State of Colorado shall not create or imply the creation of protective perimeters or buffer zones around any wilderness area or the Protection Area. The fact that nonwilderness activities or uses can be seen or heard from within a wilderness area or Protection Area shall not, of itself, preclude such activities or uses up to the boundary of the wilderness area or the Protection Area.


(b) Rollins Pass RoadIf requested by one or more of the Colorado Counties of Grand, Gilpin, and Boulder, the Secretary shall provide technical assistance and otherwise cooperate with respect to repairing the Rollins Pass road in those counties sufficiently to allow two-wheel-drive vehicles to travel between Colorado State Highway 119 and U.S. Highway 40. If this road is repaired to such extent, the Secretary shall close the motorized roads and trails on Forest Service land indicated on the map entitled “Rollins Pass Road Reopening: Attendant Road and Trail Closures”, dated September 2001.
