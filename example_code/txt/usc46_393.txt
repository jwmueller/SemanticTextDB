Historical and Revision NotesRevised section 14103
Source: International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships.
Section 14103(a) authorizes the Secretary to delegate to a qualified person the authority to measure a vessel and issue an International Tonnage Certificate or other certificate of measurement. The term “qualified person” means an organization that the Secretary believes has the necessary qualifications to measure a vessel competently, such as the American Bureau of Shipping.
The conferees intend that in section 14103 the term “qualified person” includes not only organizations that the Secretary finds to be qualified to perform measurement duties, but any person as that term is defined in section 1 of title 1, United States Code (including individuals), that the Secretary determines qualified to perform measurement duties. The House and Senate conferees also agree that, where authorized, in addition to information required by the Secretary, regulatory tonnage should be used on all certificates and documents related to a vessel unless the owner otherwise requests.
Section 14103(b) provides for the appeal to the Secretary of a decision made by a person that has received delegated authority. This ensures that the Secretary has full oversight of delegated tonnage measurement functions.
Section 14103(c) authorizes the Secretary to delegate to a country that is a party to the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969, the authority to measure a vessel and issue an International Tonnage Certificate.
Section 14103(d) clarifies the Secretary’s authority to revoke at any time and without cause a delegation of authority to measure a vessel or issue a certificate. This authority is given so that no delay occurs administratively in revoking a delegation wherever the Secretary decides a revocation is warranted.

Amendments2010—Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 111–281 substituted “that engages on” for “intended to be engaged on”.
