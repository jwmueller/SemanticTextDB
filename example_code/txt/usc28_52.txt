The reference to Raton as a place of holding court was omitted on advice of the clerk that court is no longer held there.
Provisions for furnishing rooms and accommodations at Las Vegas were omitted as obsolete upon advice of Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts that Federal accommodations are now available.
