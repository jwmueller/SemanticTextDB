(b), was executed to this section, which is section 381 of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93–415), to reflect the probable intent of Congress and the intervening renumbering of section 361 of Pub. L. 93–415 as section 381 by section 3(g)(1)(A)(ii) of Pub. L. 102–586.

L. 101–204, § 1003(2), substituted “Not later than 180 days after the end of each fiscal year, the Secretary shall submit a report to the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate” for “The Secretary shall annually report to the Congress”.
1988—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 100–690, §§ 7271(c)(5), 7273(c)(1), (2), 7274, designated existing provisions as subsec. (a), in introductory provisions substituted “Not later than 180 days after the end of each fiscal year, the Secretary shall” for “The Secretary shall annually”, “runaway and homeless youth centers” for “runaway centers”, and “part A of this subchapter” for “this part”, and in par. (1) substituted “runaway and homeless youth” for “runaway youth”.
Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 100–690, § 7273(c)(3), added subsec. (b).
1980—Pub. L. 96–509 substituted “centers” for “houses”.
