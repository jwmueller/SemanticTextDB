“The Congress finds that transactions in government securities are affected with a public interest which makes it necessary—“(1) to provide for the integrity, stability, and efficiency of such transactions and of matters and practices related thereto;

“(2) to impose adequate regulation of government securities brokers and government securities dealers generally; and

“(3) to require appropriate financial responsibility, recordkeeping, reporting, and related regulatory requirements;


in order to protect investors and to insure the maintenance of fair, honest, and liquid markets in such securities.”
