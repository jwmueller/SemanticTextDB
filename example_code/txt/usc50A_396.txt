§ 1984. Compromise of claims by Attorney General; jurisdiction of United States Court of Federal Claims to determine claims timely filed; report to Congress; payment of awards; finality of decisions(a) The Attorney General is authorized to compromise and settle and make an award in an amount not to exceed $100,000 on any claim timely filed under this Act, as amended [sections 1981 to 1987 of this Appendix], on the basis of affidavits, available Government records, and other information satisfactory to him.

(b) The United States Court of Federal Claims shall have jurisdiction to determine any claim timely filed under this Act [sections 1981 to 1987 of this Appendix]. A petition for the determination of a claim by the United States Court of Federal Claims shall be filed with the clerk of the said court and a copy of the petition shall be served upon the Attorney General by registered mail. Such a petition may be filed at any time after enactment of this subsection except that it must be filed within ninety days after the date of a notice by the Attorney General served on the claimant by registered mail that no further consideration will be given to the compromise of the claim. Upon the timely filing and serving of such petition, the United States Court of Federal Claims shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine said claim in the same manner and under the same rules as any other cause properly before it and applying rules of equity and justice. Upon being served with a copy of such petition, the Attorney General shall forthwith certify and transmit to the clerk of the United States Court of Federal Claims the original statement of the claim and any requested amendments thereto for filing with the said clerk as a preliminary record in the case.

(c) On the first day of each regular session of Congress the Attorney General shall transmit to Congress a full and complete statement of all compromise settlements effected by the Attorney General under this Act, as amended [sections 1981 to 1987 of this Appendix], during the previous year, stating the name and address of each claimant, the amount claimed, and the amount awarded. All awards shall be paid in like manner as are final judgments of the United States Court of Federal Claims.

(d) Except as herein provided, the payment of an award shall be final and conclusive for all purposes, notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, and shall be a full discharge of the United States and all of its officers, agents, servants, and employees with respect to all claims arising out of the same subject matter.
