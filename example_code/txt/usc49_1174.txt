(B) under letters rogatory issued by a court of competent jurisdiction at the request of the Secretary, Under Secretary, or Administrator.



(d) Witness Fees and Mileage and Certain Foreign Country Expenses.—A witness summoned before the Secretary, Under Secretary, or Administrator or whose deposition is taken under this section and the individual taking the deposition are each entitled to the same fee and mileage that the witness and individual would have been paid for those services in a court of the United States.

In this section, the word “Administrator” in section 313(c) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Public Law 85–726, 72 Stat. 753) is retained on authority of 49:106(g).
Subsection (a)(1) is substituted for “sign and issue subpenas”, “shall have the power to require by subpena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of all books, papers, and documents relating to any matter under investigation”, and “The attendance of witnesses, and the production of books, papers, and documents, may be required from any place in the United States, at any designated place of hearing” in 49 App.:1484 for clarity and consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code and to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsection (b), the words “petition a court of the United States to enforce the subpena” are substituted for “invoke the aid of any court of the United States in requiring attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of such books, papers, and documents under the provisions of this section” in 49 App.:1484(c) to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “to enforce a subpena under this section” are substituted for “in case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpena issued to any person, issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Board (and produce books, papers, or documents if so ordered) and give evidence touching the matter in question” in 49 App.:1484(d) to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsection (c)(1), the words “pending before it, at any stage of such proceeding or investigation” in 49 App.:1484(e) are omitted as surplus. The words “a person to give” are substituted for “to be taken”, and the words “to produce records” are added, for clarity and consistency. The last sentence is substituted for 49 App.:1484(e) (last sentence) for clarity and consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsection (c)(4), the words “shall be cautioned . . . to testify the whole truth, and shall be carefully examined” in 49 App.:1484(f) are omitted as surplus. The words “shall be under oath” are substituted for “shall be required to swear (or affirm, if he so requests)” for consistency and because of 1:1.
In subsection (d), the words “that the witness and individual would have been” are added for clarity and consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. The words “fees, charges, or” and “on the subject” are omitted as surplus.
In subsection (e), the words “duly . . . for such purpose” are omitted as surplus. The words “employee appointed under section 3105 of title 5” are substituted for “examiner”, and the words “subpena witnesses” are substituted for “sign and issue subpenas”, for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. The words “In all cases heard by an examiner or a single member” are omitted as surplus.
