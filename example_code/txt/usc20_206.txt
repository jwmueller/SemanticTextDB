(June 20, 1936, ch. 638, § 6, as added Pub. L. 93–516, title II, § 206, Dec. 7, 1974, 88 Stat. 1626; Pub. L. 93–651, title II, § 206, Nov. 21, 1974, 89 Stat. 2–11.)

Codification
The content of Pub. L. 93–516, including provisions of section 206 thereof which enacted this section, were originally contained in H.R. 14225, 93rd Congress, Second Session, which was pocket-vetoed during the 31-day intrasession adjournment of the 93rd Congress for the Congressional elections in November, 1974.
Pursuant to an order of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (Kennedy v. Jones, D.C.D.C. 1976, 412 F.Supp. 353) H.R. 14225 was deemed to have become law without the approval of the President on Nov. 21, 1974, and was given the designation Pub. L. 93–651. Therefore, for purposes of codification, this section should be deemed to have been enacted by Pub. L. 93–651, title II, § 206, Nov. 21, 1974, 89 Stat. 2–11, in exactly the same manner as it was enacted by Pub. L. 93–516.

Prior ProvisionsA prior section 6 of act June 20, 1936, which was classified to section 107e of this title, was renumbered section 9 by Pub. L. 93–516, § 206.
