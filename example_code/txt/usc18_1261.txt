(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 841, § 3618; renumbered § 3669, Pub. L. 98–473, title II, § 212(a)(1), Oct. 12, 1984, 98 Stat. 1987.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 247 of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians (Mar. 2, 1917, ch. 146, § 1, 39 Stat. 970).
Words “Automobiles or any other vehicles or” at beginning of section were omitted, and “any conveyance” substituted to remove possible ambiguity as to scope of section.
Words at conclusion of section “provided in section 246 of this title” added nothing and were therefore omitted. (See also rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.)
Minor changes were made in arrangement and phraseology.
