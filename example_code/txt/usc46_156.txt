Section 5116 provides penalties for violations of load line requirements. The penalties are raised substantially from existing law to provide a sufficient deterrence against violations of the load line requirements and to conform with the level of penalties throughout the subtitle. The monetary penalties have not been changed since the 1930’s.
Section 5116(a) raises from $1,000 to $5,000 the maximum penalty for violation of a load line provision under this chapter or a regulation promulgated under this chapter.
Section 5116(b) raises from $1,000 to $10,000 the maximum penalty for loading a vessel in such a way as to submerge the load line. In addition, a violator must pay up to two times the amount of the economic benefit of the overloading.
Section 5116(c) raises from $500 to $5,000 the maximum penalty for a violation of the requirement in section 5112(b) that the load line position and draft of a vessel be noted in the logbook.
Section 5116(a)–(c) also states that the vessel is liable in rem for the penalty.
Section 5116(d) raises from $1,000 to $10,000 the maximum penalty for a violation of a detention order and may also include imprisonment for up to one year.
Section 5116(e) raises from $2,000 to $10,000 the maximum penalty for the alteration, removal, or concealment of a load line mark and may also include imprisonment for two years.
