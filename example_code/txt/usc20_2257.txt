§ 9814. Programs for master’s degrees in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or critical foreign language education(a) Program authorizedFrom the amounts made available to carry out this section under section 9816(2) of this title and not reserved under section 9815(d) of this title for a fiscal year, the Secretary is authorized to award grants, on a competitive basis, to eligible recipients to enable the partnerships served by the eligible recipients to develop and implement—(1) 2- or 3-year part-time master’s degree programs in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or critical foreign language education for teachers in order to enhance the teacher’s content knowledge and teaching skills; or

(2) programs for professionals in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or a critical foreign language that lead to a 1-year master’s degree in teaching that results in teacher certification.


(b) ApplicationEach eligible recipient desiring a grant under this section shall submit an application to the Secretary at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may require. Each application shall describe—(1) how a department of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or a critical foreign language will ensure significant collaboration with a school, department, or program of education in the development of the master’s degree programs authorized under subsection (a), or how a department or school with a competency-based degree program has ensured, in the development of a master’s degree program, the provision of rigorous studies in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or a critical foreign language that enhance the teachers’ content knowledge and teaching skills;

(2) the role of the local educational agency in the partnership in developing and administering the program and how feedback from the local educational agency, school, and participants will be used to improve the program;

(3) how the program will help increase the percentage of highly qualified mathematics, science, or critical foreign language teachers, including increasing the percentage of such teachers teaching in schools determined by the partnership to be most in need;

(4) how the program will—(A) improve student academic achievement in mathematics, science, and, where applicable, technology and engineering and increase the number of students taking upper-level courses in such subjects; or

(B) increase the numbers of elementary school and secondary school students enrolled and continuing in critical foreign language courses;


(5) how the program will prepare participants to become more effective science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or critical foreign language teachers;

(6) how the program will prepare participants to assume leadership roles in their schools;

(7) how teachers (or science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or critical foreign language professionals) who are members of groups that are underrepresented in the teaching of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or critical foreign languages and teachers from schools determined by the partnership to be most in need will be encouraged to apply for and participate in the program;

(8) the ongoing activities and services that will be provided to graduates of the program;

(9) how the partnership will continue the activities assisted under the grant when the grant period ends;

(10) how the partnership will assess, during the program, the content knowledge and teaching skills of the program participants; and

(11) methods to ensure applicants to the master’s degree program for professionals in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or a critical foreign language demonstrate advanced knowledge in the relevant subject.


(c) Authorized activitiesEach eligible recipient receiving a grant under this section shall use the grant funds to develop and implement a 2- or 3-year part-time master’s degree program in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or critical foreign language education for teachers in order to enhance the teachers’ content knowledge and teaching skills, or programs for professionals in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or a critical foreign language that lead to a 1-year master’s degree in teaching that results in teacher certification. The program shall—(1) promote effective teaching skills so that program participants become more effective science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or critical foreign language teachers;

(2) prepare teachers to assume leadership roles in their schools by participating in activities such as teacher mentoring, development of curricula that integrate state of the art applications of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or critical foreign language into the classroom, working with school administrators in establishing in-service professional development of teachers, and assisting in evaluating data and assessments to improve student academic achievement;

(3) use high-quality research, laboratory, or internship experiences for program participants that are integrated with coursework;

(4) provide student teaching or clinical classroom experience;

(5) if implementing a program in which participants are prepared to teach science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or critical foreign language courses, provide strategies for improving student literacy;

(6) align the content knowledge in the master’s degree program with challenging student academic achievement standards and challenging academic content standards established by the State in which the program is conducted;

(7) encourage the participation of—(A) individuals who are members of groups that are underrepresented in the teaching of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or critical foreign languages;

(B) members of the Armed Forces who are transitioning to civilian life; and

(C) teachers teaching in schools determined by the partnership to be most in need;


(8) offer tuition assistance, based on need, as appropriate;

(9) create opportunities for enhanced and ongoing professional development for teachers that improves the science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and critical foreign language content knowledge and teaching skills of such teachers; and

(10) evaluate and report on the impact of the program, in accordance with subsection (d).


(d) Evaluation and reportEach eligible recipient receiving a grant under this section shall evaluate, using measurable objectives and benchmarks, and provide an annual report to the Secretary regarding, the extent to which the program assisted under this section succeeded in the following:(1) Increasing the number and percentage of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or critical foreign language teachers who have a master’s degree and meet 1 or more of the following requirements:(A) Are teaching in schools determined by the partnership to be most in need, and taught in such schools prior to participation in the program.

(B) Are teaching in schools determined by the partnership to be most in need, and did not teach in such schools prior to participation in the program.

(C) Are members of a group underrepresented in the teaching of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or a critical foreign language.


(2) Bringing professionals in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or a critical foreign language into the field of teaching.

(3) Retaining teachers who participate in the program.
