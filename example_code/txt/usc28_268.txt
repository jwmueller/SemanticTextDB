Historical and Revision Notes



1966 Act


DerivationU.S. CodeRevised Statutes andStatutes at Large


 28 U.S.C. 506.[None].



1948 ActPrior section 506.—Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 511 (R.S. § 793; June 24, 1898, ch. 495, § 2, 30 Stat. 487; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 291, 36 Stat. 1167).
Words “United States attorney” were substituted for “district attorney.” (See Reviser’s Note under section 501 [now 541] of this title.)
Words “The Supreme Court of the Territory, and the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia” were omitted as obsolete. This section, as revised, applies to all districts enumerated in chapter 5 of this title. There were no provisions respecting vacancies in Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Therefore this section remedies this situation and establishes a uniform method to fill interim vacancies.
Words “and a copy shall be entered on the journal of the court” after “filed in the clerk’s office of said court”, in section 511 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as unnecessary.
The provisions of section 511 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to marshals, are incorporated in sections 544 and 545 [see Prior Provisions notes under those sections] of this title.
Changes were made in phraseology.
