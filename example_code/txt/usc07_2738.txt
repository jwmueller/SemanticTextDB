§ 8103. Biorefinery, renewable chemical, and biobased product manufacturing assistance(a) PurposeThe purpose of this section is to assist in the development of new and emerging technologies for the development of advanced biofuels, renewable chemicals, and biobased product manufacturing so as to—(1) increase the energy independence of the United States;

(2) promote resource conservation, public health, and the environment;

(3) diversify markets for agricultural and forestry products and agriculture waste material; and

(4) create jobs and enhance the economic development of the rural economy.


(b) DefinitionsIn this section:(1) Biobased product manufacturingThe term “biobased product manufacturing” means development, construction, and retrofitting of technologically new commercial-scale processing and manufacturing equipment and required facilities that will be used to convert renewable chemicals and other biobased outputs of biorefineries into end-user products on a commercial scale.


(2) Eligible entityThe term “eligible entity” means an individual, entity, Indian tribe, or unit of State or local government, including a corporation, farm cooperative, farmer cooperative organization, association of agricultural producers, National Laboratory, institution of higher education, rural electric cooperative, public power entity, or consortium of any of those entities.


(3) Eligible technologyThe term “eligible technology” means, as determined by the Secretary—(A) a technology that is being adopted in a viable commercial-scale operation of a biorefinery that produces an advanced biofuel; and

(B) a technology not described in subparagraph (A) that has been demonstrated to have technical and economic potential for commercial application in a biorefinery that produces an advanced biofuel.



(c) AssistanceThe Secretary shall make available to eligible entities guarantees for loans made to fund the development, construction, and retrofitting of commercial-scale biorefineries using eligible technology.


(d) Loan guarantees(1) Selection criteria(A) In generalIn approving loan guarantee applications, the Secretary shall establish a priority scoring system that assigns priority scores to each application and only approve applications that exceed a specified minimum, as determined by the Secretary.


(B) FeasibilityIn approving a loan guarantee application, the Secretary shall determine the technical and economic feasibility of the project based on a feasibility study of the project described in the application conducted by an independent third party.


(C) Scoring systemIn determining the priority scoring system for loan guarantees under subsection (c), the Secretary shall consider—(i) whether the applicant has established a market for the advanced biofuel and the byproducts produced;

(ii) whether the area in which the applicant proposes to place the biorefinery has other similar facilities;

(iii) whether the applicant is proposing to use a feedstock not previously used in the production of advanced biofuels;

(iv) whether the applicant is proposing to work with producer associations or cooperatives;

(v) the level of financial participation by the applicant, including support from non-Federal and private sources;

(vi) whether the applicant has established that the adoption of the process proposed in the application will have a positive impact on resource conservation, public health, and the environment;

(vii) whether the applicant can establish that if adopted, the biofuels production technology proposed in the application will not have any significant negative impacts on existing manufacturing plants or other facilities that use similar feedstocks;

(viii) the potential for rural economic development;

(ix) the level of local ownership proposed in the application; and

(x) whether the project can be replicated.


(D) Project diversityIn approving loan guarantee applications, the Secretary shall ensure that, to the extent practicable, there is diversity in the types of projects approved for loan guarantees to ensure that as wide a range as possible of technologies, products, and approaches are assisted.



(2) Limitations(A) Maximum amount of loan guaranteedThe principal amount of a loan guaranteed under subsection (c) may not exceed $250,000,000.


(B) Maximum percentage of loan guaranteed(i) In generalExcept as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, a loan guaranteed under subsection (c) shall be in an amount not to exceed 80 percent of the project costs, as determined by the Secretary.


(ii) Other direct Federal fundingThe amount of a loan guaranteed for a project under subsection (c) shall be reduced by the amount of other direct Federal funding that the eligible entity receives for the same project.


(iii) Authority to guarantee the loanThe Secretary may guarantee up to 90 percent of the principal and interest due on a loan guaranteed under subsection (c).



(C) Loan guarantee fund distributionOf the funds made available for loan guarantees for a fiscal year under subsection (g), 50 percent of the funds shall be reserved for obligation during the second half of the fiscal year.

(f) Condition on provision of assistance(1) In generalAs a condition of receiving a grant or loan guarantee under this section, an eligible entity shall ensure that all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors in the performance of construction work financed, in whole or in part, with the grant or loan guarantee, as the case may be, shall be paid wages at rates not less than those prevailing on similar construction in the locality, as determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with sections 3141 through 3144, 3146, and 3147 of title 40.


(2) Authority and functionsThe Secretary of Labor shall have, with respect to the labor standards described in paragraph (1), the authority and functions set forth in Reorganization Plan Numbered 14 of 1950 (5 U.S.C. App) and section 3145 of title 40.

(ii) $50,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2015 and 2016.


(B) Biobased product manufacturingOf the total amount of funds made available for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 under subparagraph (A), the Secretary may use for the cost of loan guarantees under this section not more than 15 percent of such funds to promote biobased product manufacturing.



(2) Discretionary fundingIn addition to any other funds made available to carry out this section, there is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section $75,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2014 through 2018.
