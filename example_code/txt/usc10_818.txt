“SEC. 726. PAYMENTS FOR SERVICES.“(a) Form of Payment.—Unless otherwise agreed to by the Secretary and a designated provider, the form of payment for health care services provided by a designated provider shall be on a full risk capitation payment basis. The capitation payments shall be negotiated and agreed upon by the Secretary and the designated provider. In addition to such other factors as the parties may agree to apply, the capitation payments shall be based on the utilization experience of enrollees and competitive market rates for equivalent health care services for a comparable population to such enrollees in the area in which the designated provider is located.

“(b) Limitation on Total Payments.—Total capitation payments for health care services to a designated provider shall not exceed an amount equal to the cost that would have been incurred by the Government if the enrollees had received such health care services through a military treatment facility, the TRICARE program, or the Medicare program, as the case may be. In establishing the ceiling rate for enrollees with the designated providers who are also eligible for the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services, the Secretary of Defense shall take into account the health status of the enrollees.

“(c) Establishment of Payment Rates on Annual Basis.—The Secretary and a designated provider shall establish capitation payments on an annual basis, subject to periodic review for actuarial soundness and to adjustment for any adverse or favorable selection reasonably anticipated to result from the design of the program under this subtitle.

“(d) Alternative Basis for Calculating Payments.—After September 30, 1999, the Secretary and a designated provider may mutually agree upon a new basis for calculating capitation payments.
