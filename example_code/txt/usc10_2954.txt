In subsection (a) the words “consider, ascertain, adjust, determine” are omitted as covered by the word “settle”, as defined in section 7621(b) of this title. The words “of the United States” (following the word “property”), “by contract or otherwise”, and “thereto” are omitted as surplusage. The words “of a kind that is within the admiralty jurisdiction of” are substituted for the words “cognizable in admiralty in”. The words “receive payment of a claim * * * if the net amount to be received by the United States is not more than $1,000,000” are substituted for the words “receive in payment of any such claim the amount due the United States pursuant to determination, compromise, or settlement as herein authorized * * * Provided, further, That no settlement or compromise where there is involved a payment in the net amount of over $1,000,000 shall be authorized by this Act”.
In subsection (b) the words “and to deliver” are omitted as covered by the word “execute”. The words “Amounts received under this section” are substituted for the words “All such payments” for clarity and uniformity. The words “of the United States as miscellaneous receipts” are omitted as surplusage.
In subsection (c) the words “In any case where the amount to be received by the United States is not more than” are substituted for the words “Where the net amount received in settlement does not exceed” for clarity, since the delegation of authority necessarily precedes receipt of payment. The words “the Secretary may delegate his authority” are substituted for the words “the authority of the Secretary of the Navy * * * may be exercised” for clarity.
In subsection (d) the words “but not until then”, “for all purposes”, and “to the contrary” are omitted as surplusage.
Subsection (e) is worded to insure that the effect of a suit pending at any time is preserved and that the provision is not interpreted to apply only to suits that are pending on the date of enactment of this title.
The first proviso of 34 U.S.C. 600a, stating that this section is supplementary to, and not in lieu of, other laws authorizing the settlement of claims, is omitted as unnecessary, since the other applicable claims laws are restated in this title.
