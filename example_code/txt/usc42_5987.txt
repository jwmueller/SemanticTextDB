VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES.“(a) Establishment of Voluntary Guidelines.—Not later than one year after the date of enactment of this Act [Dec. 21, 2007], the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (in this Act referred to as the ‘Administrator’), in consultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, shall establish voluntary guidelines, based on the best currently available scientific knowledge, for the remediation of former methamphetamine laboratories, including guidelines regarding preliminary site assessment and the remediation of residual contaminants.

“(b) Considerations.—In developing the voluntary guidelines under subsection (a), the Administrator shall consider, at a minimum—“(1) relevant standards, guidelines, and requirements found in Federal, State, and local laws and regulations;

“(2) the varying types and locations of former methamphetamine laboratories; and

“(3) the expected cost of carrying out any proposed guidelines.


“(c) States.—The voluntary guidelines should be designed to assist State and local governments in the development and the implementation of legislation and other policies to apply state-of-the-art knowledge and research results to the remediation of former methamphetamine laboratories. The Administrator shall work with State and local governments and other relevant non-Federal agencies and organizations, including through the conference described in section 5, to promote and encourage the appropriate adoption of the voluntary guidelines.

“(d) Updating the Guidelines.—The Administrator shall periodically update the voluntary guidelines as the Administrator, in consultation with States and other interested parties, determines to be necessary and appropriate to incorporate research findings and other new knowledge.
