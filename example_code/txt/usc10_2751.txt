(e) The Secretary of the Navy may limit the number of midshipmen appointed under subsection (b)(5). When he does so, if the total number of midshipmen, upon admission of a new class at the Academy, will be more than 3,737, no appointments may be made under subsection (b)(2) or (3) of this section or section 6956 of this title.

(f) The Superintendent of the Naval Academy shall furnish to any Member of Congress, upon the written request of such Member, the name of the Congressman or other nominating authority responsible for the nomination of any named or identified person for appointment to the Academy.

(g) For purposes of the limitation in subsection (a) establishing the aggregate authorized strength of the Brigade of Midshipmen, the Secretary of the Navy may for any year permit a variance in that limitation by not more than one percent. In applying that limitation, and any such variance, the last day of an academic year shall be considered to be graduation day.

All provisions of law authorizing appointments to the Naval Academy from various sources are collected in this section. The language is extensively changed to meet the needs of this organization of the source material. In those provisions that now authorize “appointments” by other than the President, the language is changed to indicate that the process is one of selection where the law requires selection by competitive examination, and to show that other candidates are nominated. The manner of appointing the selectees and nominees, in all cases, is covered in § 6953 of this title. In the case of nominees from States, the District of Columbia, Territories, and from Puerto Rico, the qualification that the nominees must be from the political subdivisions from which nominated is indicated. The requirement that the nominees be actual residents of the political subdivisions is contained in § 6958(b) of this title.
In subsection (a)(1) the words “armed forces” are substituted for the description of the land and naval forces. The words “including male and female members of” and “of all components thereof” are omitted as surplusage.
In subsection (a)(1)(B), the date February 1, 1955, fixed by Proclamation No. 3080 (Jan. 7, 1955; 20 F.R. 173), is substituted for the words “such date as shall thereafter be determined by Presidential proclamation or concurrent resolution of the Congress under section 745 of title 38”.
In subsection (b)(1) the qualification that appointees must be from the sons of members of the various “regular” components of the armed forces is added, as “Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard” are so interpreted in this statute.
In subsection (c) the proviso “That all such appointees are otherwise qualified for admission” is omitted as covered by § 6958 of this title setting forth qualifications of all candidates.
The applicability to the United States Military Academy in the Act of June 8, 1926, ch. 492, as amended (34 U.S.C. 1036a; 10 U.S.C. 1091a), was repealed by section 6(c) of the Act of June 30, 1950, ch. 421, 64 Stat. 305.

1962 ActThe change reflects the change of the name of the Panama Railroad Company to the Panama Canal Company by section 2(a)(2) of the Act of September 26, 1950 (64 Stat. 1038).
