Section 1. As used in this order:
(a) The term “the act” means the act of September 26, 1961 (Public Law 87–304), 75 Stat. 662 [now this subchapter].
(b) The term “Federal agency” means any executive department of the Government of the United States of America, any agency or independent establishment in the executive branch of the Government, and any corporation wholly owned or controlled by the Government.

Sec. 2. (a) Except as otherwise provided by section 2(b) and section 3(c) of this order, the Secretary of State in respect of civilian employees of Federal agencies who are located in foreign areas immediately prior to an emergency evacuation, and the Office of Personnel Management in respect of all other civilian employees of Federal agencies, are hereby designated and empowered, without the approval, ratification, or other action of the President, to perform the functions conferred upon the President by section 3(a), section 3(b), and section 6(a) of the act [sections 5523(a), 5523(b), and 5527(a) of this title].
(b) The Office of Personnel Management is hereby designated and empowered to perform the functions conferred upon the President by the provisions of section 5527 of title 5, United States Code, with respect to allotments and assignments authorized by section 5525 of title 5, United States Code, and advance payments to new appointees authorized by section 5524a of title 5, United States Code, as added by section 107(a) of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990, as incorporated in section 529 of Public Law 101–509.

(a) To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary of State, the Office of Personnel Management, and the heads of other Federal agencies shall exercise their authority under the act and this order so that employees of different Federal agencies evacuated from the same geographic area under the same general circumstances may be treated uniformly.
(b) Advance payments of compensation, allowances, and differentials, as authorized by section 2 of the act [section 5522 of this title], shall be held to the minimum period during which the order for evacuation is anticipated to continue, and shall in no event be made for a period of more than thirty days.

Such payments of monetary amounts under the authority of section 3 of the act shall be terminated as of such dates as may be determined by the Secretary of State or the Office of Personnel Management, as appropriate, but not later than the date on which an employee resumes his duties at the post from which he has been evacuated or is assigned to another position.
Sec. 4. (a) The head of each Federal agency shall issue as soon as practicable such regulations as may be necessary and appropriate to carry out his functions under the act and this order.
(b) In order to coordinate the policies and procedures of the executive branch of the Government, all regulations of any Federal agency prepared for issuance under the provisions of section 6(c) of the act [section 5527(c) of this title] and section 4(a) of this order shall be submitted for prior approval to the Secretary of State, or to the Office of Personnel Management, as may be appropriate, under section 2 of this order. The Secretary of State and the Office of Personnel Management shall review such regulations for conformance with the purpose and intent of the act and of the regulations contained in section 3 of this order. No Federal agency shall make any payment under the provisions of the act or this order until such regulations have been approved by the Secretary of State, or the Office of Personnel Management, as appropriate.
