Historical and Revision Notes


DerivationU.S. CodeRevised Statutes andStatutes at Large


 5 U.S.C. 91.R.S. § 188.


The section is reorganized and restated for clarity.
In subsection (a), the word “concerning” is substituted for “touching”.
In subsection (b), the words “without delay” are omitted as unnecessary in view of the requirement that the statement be furnished “Within a reasonable time”. The word “briefly” is substituted for “succinctly”. The words “in suit” are omitted as unnecessary.
The words “executive department” are substituted for “department” because “department” as used in R.S. § 188 meant “executive department”. (See R.S. § 159.) The words “military department” are inserted to preserve the application of the source law. Before enactment of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 578), the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force were Executive departments. The National Security Act Amendments of 1949 established the Department of Defense as an Executive Department including the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force as military departments, not as Executive departments. However, the source law for this section, which was in effect in 1949, remained applicable to the Secretaries of the military departments by virtue of section 12(g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 591), which is set out in the reviser’s note for section 301 of title 5, United States Code.

Amendments1992—Pub. L. 102–572 substituted “United States Court of Federal Claims” for “United States Claims Court” in section catchline and subsec. (a).

Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 97–164, § 118(a)(1), substituted “United States Claims Court or in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit” for “Court of Claims”.
