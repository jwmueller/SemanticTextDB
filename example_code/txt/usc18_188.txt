Reference to any person causing, procuring, aiding or assisting was omitted as unnecessary as such persons are made principals by section 2 of this title.
At the end of this section words “in the discretion of the court” were omitted as unnecessary, as the punishment provisions, being framed in the alternative by the use of the disjunctive “or,” vest in the court the power to impose a fine or prison sentence in its discretion.
Changes in phraseology were made.

Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322, which directed the amendment of this section by substituting “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000”, was executed by making the substitution for “fined not more than $1,000”, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
