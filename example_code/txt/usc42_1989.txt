“(b) Significantly Disproportionate Employer Pension and Insurance Fund Contribution.—“(1) In general.—For purposes of this section, a significantly disproportionate employer pension and insurance fund contribution described in this subsection with respect to a State is any identifiable employer contribution towards pension or other employee insurance funds that is estimated to accrue to residents of such State for a calendar year (beginning with calendar year 2003) if the increase in the amount so estimated exceeds 25 percent of the total increase in personal income in that State for the year involved.

“(2) Data to be used.—For estimating and adjustment a FMAP already calculated as of the date of the enactment of this Act [Feb. 4, 2009] for a State with a significantly disproportionate employer pension and insurance fund contribution, the Secretary shall use the personal income data set originally used in calculating such FMAP.

“(3) Special adjustment for negative growth.—If in any calendar year the total personal income growth in a State is negative, an employer pension and insurance fund contribution for the purposes of calculating the State’s FMAP for a calendar year shall not exceed 125 percent of the amount of such contribution for the previous calendar year for the State.


“(c) Hold Harmless.—No State shall have its FMAP for a fiscal year reduced as a result of the application of this section.

“(d) Report.—Not later than May 15, 2009, the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a report on the problems presented by the current treatment of pension and insurance fund contributions in the use of Bureau of Economic Affairs calculations for the FMAP and for Medicaid and on possible alternative methodologies to mitigate such problems.
