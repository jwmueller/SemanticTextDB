“Congress makes the following findings:
“(1) The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the dissolution of the Soviet Union have fundamentally changed the military threat that formed the basis for the national security policy of the United States since the end of World War II.

“(2) The change in the military threat presents a unique opportunity to restructure and reduce the military requirements of the United States.

“(3) As the United States proceeds with the post-Cold War defense build down, the Nation must recognize and address the impact of reduced defense spending on the military personnel, civilian employees, and defense industry workers who have been the foundation of the national defense policies of the United States.

“(4) The defense build down will have a significant impact on communities as procurements are reduced and military installations are closed and realigned.

“(5) Despite the changes in the military threat, the United States must maintain the capability to respond to regional conflicts that threaten the national interests of the United States, and to reconstitute forces in the event of an extended conflict.

“(6) The skills and capabilities of military personnel, civilian employees of the Department of Defense, defense industry workers, and defense industries represent an invaluable national resource that can contribute to the economic growth of the United States and to the long-term vitality of the national technology and industrial base.

“(7) Prompt and vigorous implementation of defense conversion, reinvestment, and transition assistance programs is essential to ensure that the defense build down is structured in a manner that—“(A) enhances the long-term ability of the United States to maintain a strong and vibrant national technology and industrial base; and

“(B) promotes economic growth.”
