“Nothing in the amendments made by this section [amending this section and sections 623, 1053, and 1054 of Title 29, Labor] shall be construed to create an inference with respect to—“(1) the treatment of applicable defined benefit plans or conversions to applicable defined benefit plans under sections 204(b)(1)(H) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [29 U.S.C. 1054(b)(1)(H)], 4(i)(1) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 [29 U.S.C. 623(i)(1)], and 411(b)(1)(H) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as in effect before such amendments, or

“(2) the determination of whether an applicable defined benefit plan fails to meet the requirements of sections 203(a)(2), 204(c), or 205(g) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [29 U.S.C. 1053(a)(2), 1054(c), 1055(g)] or sections 411(a)(2), 411(c), or 417(e) of such Code, as in effect before such amendments, solely because the present value of the accrued benefit (or any portion thereof) of any participant is, under the terms of the plan, equal to the amount expressed as the balance in a hypothetical account or as an accumulated percentage of the participant’s final average compensation.


For purposes of this subsection, the term ‘applicable defined benefit plan’ has the meaning given such term by section 203(f)(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [29 U.S.C. 1053(f)(3)] and section 411(a)(13)(C) of such Code, as in effect after such amendments.”
