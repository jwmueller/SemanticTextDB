References in TextSection 1424 of Public Law 101–510, referred to in subsecs. (d)(3), (f)(2), and (k)(2)(A), is section 1424 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991, which is set out as a note under section 7291 of this title.

Codification
Pub. L. 102–396, title V, Oct. 6, 1992, 106 Stat. 1896, provided that section 1024 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 [H.R. 5006, Pub. L. 102–484], as it passed the Senate on Oct. 3, 1992, shall be amended in subsection 2218(c)(2) proposed for inclusion in this chapter by deleting all after “expended only” down to and including “appropriations Act” and inserting in lieu thereof “in amounts authorized by law”. It further provided that for purposes of that amendment, Pub. L. 102–396 shall be treated as having been enacted after Pub. L. 102–484, regardless of the actual dates of enactment. The date of Oct. 3, 1992, referred to as the date the Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993, apparently is based on an order adopted by the Senate on Oct. 3, 1992 [Cong. Rec., vol. 138, p. 30919] providing that when the conference report on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 was received by the Senate from the House of Representatives it would be deemed to have been agreed to.
