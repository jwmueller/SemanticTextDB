REPORTS BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.“(a) In General.—Beginning in the year 1998, the Attorney General shall report to the Congress not later than May 1 of each year through the year 2002 on the status of the United States Parole Commission. Unless the Attorney General, in such report, certifies that the continuation of the Commission is the most effective and cost-efficient manner for carrying out the Commission’s functions, the Attorney General shall include in such report an alternative plan for a transfer of the Commission’s functions to another entity.

In the event such plan takes effect, all laws pertaining to the authority and jurisdiction of the Commission with respect to individual offenders shall remain in effect notwithstanding the expiration of the period specified in section 2 of this Act.

“(2) Conditional repeal.—Effective on the date such plan takes effect, paragraphs (3) and (4) of section 235(b) of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 [Pub. L. 98–473, set out as a note under section 3551 of this title] (98 Stat. 2032) are repealed.”
