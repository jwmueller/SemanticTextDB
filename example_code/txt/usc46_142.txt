Historical and Revision NotesRevised section 5102
Source: Section (U.S. Code) 46 App. U.S.C. 86b, 86c, 88.
The delineation of the vessels that will be subject to load line requirements is made in section 5102 as follows: subsection (a) is an all-inclusive list of vessels subject to load line requirements, followed by subsection (b) which specifically exempts those vessels to which the requirements do not apply.
Section 5102(a) lists five categories of vessels which are subject to load line requirements. They are as follows:
Clause (1) regarding “a vessel of the United States” includes all vessels documented under Chapter 121 of title 46 or numbered under Chapter 123 of title 46.
Clause (2) regarding “a vessel on the navigable waters of the United States” includes all domestic or foreign vessels found in or on the navigable waters of the United States.
Clause (3) regarding “a vessel owned by a citizen of the United States or a corporation established by or under the laws of the United States or a State, and not registered in a foreign country” includes all vessels owned by citizens of the United States (as defined in 5107(7)) [sic] and not registered under the laws of a foreign country, wherever the vessels may be located.
Clause (4) regarding “a public vessel of the United States” includes all United States public vessels.
Clause (5) regarding “a vessel otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the United States” includes foreign vessels that are subject to United States jurisdiction as a result of bilateral agreements, licenses, customary international law or other means, including those using deepwater port or outer continental shelf or EEZ facilities located in areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.
Section 5102(b) lists the specific exemptions from load line requirements. The specific exemptions may be grouped as follows:
(a) Vessel type (ships of war, pleasure vessels, fishing vessels, small passenger vessels on domestic voyages);
(b) Area of operation (rivers, harbors, bays, sounds, etc.);
(c) Minimum size (length); and
(d) Treaty exclusions.
Clause (1) exempts vessels of war from load line requirements.
Clause (2) exempts recreational vessels operated only for pleasure from load line requirements.
Clause (3) exempts fishing vessels from load line requirements.
Clauses (4) and (5) exempt certain existing fish processing and fish tender vessels not on a foreign voyage from load line requirements. The exception is limited to those vessels not on international voyages to ensure compliance with United States obligations under the International Load Line Convention.
Clause (6) exempts from load line requirements all U.S. vessels operating on domestic voyages within the Boundary Line, as defined in section 2101 of this title, except vessels operating on the Great Lakes.
Clause (7) exempts all vessels that are less than 24 meters (79 feet) in length from load line requirements whether on international or domestic voyages.
Clause (8) exempts from load line requirements those public vessels that are on domestic voyages.
Clause (9) exempts from load line requirements those vessels which have been excluded from the requirements “by specific action of a treaty of the United States.” The only current treaty which excludes vessels from load line requirements is the Convention Between the United States of America and the Dominion of Canada Concerning Load Lines (49 Stat. 2685), which entered into force on August 11, 1934.
Clause (10) exempts from load line requirements existing U.S. vessels that are under 150 gross tons while engaged on a domestic voyage. This is a grandfather provision, continuing the existing exemption for these vessels. Vessels built after January 1, 1986 must be marked with a load line, however, if they are over 79 feet long and do not qualify for any other exemption.
Clause (11) exempts small passenger vessels engaged on domestic voyages from load line requirements. Small passenger vessels are inspected under Subchapter T of Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Under Subchapter T, the Coast Guard regulates these vessels with regard to safety; the requirements are based on the number of passengers, length, and gross tonnage of the vessel. Safety-related requirements in Subchapter T regulations include hull structure and watertightness, stability, weathertight integrity, and safe movement of persons on deck, the principal safety features covered by load line regulations. This specific exemption from load line requirements for small passenger vessels is consistent with existing law and does not alter in any way the Coast Guard’s authority to regulate small passenger vessels under Subchapter T.
Clause (12) exempts vessels of the working voyages from the requirement to have load lines.
Section 5102(c) authorizes the Secretary to assign load lines for any vessel exempted from load line requirements by subsection (b) upon the request of the owner. It also provides that any exempted vessel for which load lines are assigned will remain subject to the load line requirements until its load line certificate is surrendered and the load line marks are removed.
Section 5102(d) provides that this chapter shall not be construed as abrogating the provisions of other treaties and conventions to which the United States is a party, which are not in conflict with the International Convention on Load Lines.
