(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 534; Pub. L. 98–557, § 15(a)(2), (3)(D), (4)(D)(i), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2865, 2866.)

Historical and Revision NotesDerived from title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 533 (Mar. 3, 1909, ch. 255, 35 Stat. 768; Apr. 14, 1937, ch. 78, 50 Stat. 63; June 10, 1939, ch. 196, 53 Stat. 814; Jan. 23, 1942, ch. 15, 56 Stat. 13; Apr. 9, 1943, ch. 39, 57 Stat. 60).
Said section granted authority for the Secretary of the Navy to sell designated stores to officers and enlisted men. It is deemed desirable to grant similar authority to the Secretary having control of the Coast Guard.
Said section would in no way be affected. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

Amendments1984—Pub. L. 98–557 in section catchline substituted “members” for “officers, enlisted men,” and in text substituted “surviving spouses” for “widows” and “members” for “officers and enlisted men” in two places.
