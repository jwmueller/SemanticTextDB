References in TextThe Energy Policy and Conservation Act, referred to in par. (2), is Pub. L. 94–163, Dec. 22, 1975, 89 Stat. 871, as amended, which is classified principally to chapter 77 (§ 6201 et seq.) of this title. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 6201 of this title and Tables.
Executive Order 12003, referred to in par. (2), is Ex. Ord. No. 12003, July 20, 1977, 42 F.R. 37523 which amended Ex. Ord. No. 11912, April 13, 1976, 41 F.R. 15825, set out as a note under section 6201 of this title.
Executive Order 12759, referred to in par. (2), is Ex. Ord. No. 12759, April 17, 1991, 56 F.R. 16257, as amended, which was set out as a note under section 6201 of this title, prior to revocation by Ex. Ord. No. 13123, § 604, June 3, 1999, 64 F.R. 30859, formerly set out as a note under section 8251 of this title.

Amendments1992—Pub. L. 102–486 amended section generally. Prior to amendment, section read as follows: “Each agency, in support of the President’s annual budget request to the Congress, shall specifically set forth and identify funds requested for energy conservation measures.”
1988—Pub. L. 100–615 amended section generally, substituting provision relating to budget treatment for energy conservation measures for provisions relating to establishment and use of life cycle cost methods, use of life cycle costs, and use in non-Federal structures.
1986—Subsec. (a)(2). Pub. L. 99–509 substituted “average” for “marginal”.
1980—Subsec. (a)(1). Pub. L. 96–294, which directed amendment of par. (1) by inserting provisions setting forth criteria for establishing life-cycle costs for Federal buildings before the period at end, was executed to par. (2) as the probable intent of Congress because par. (1) does not contain a period.
