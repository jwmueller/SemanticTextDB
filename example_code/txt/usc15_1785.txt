(b) Testing, certification, and notice requirements of Environmental Protection Agency; interagency enforcement agreements between Federal Trade Commission and Environmental Protection Agency and other Federal agencies(1) The Environmental Protection Agency—(A) may conduct field testing of the automotive fuel rating of automotive fuel, comparing the tested automotive fuel rating of fuel at retail outlets with the automotive fuel rating posted at those outlets;

(B) shall certify the results of such tests and comparisons to the Federal Trade Commission; and

(C) shall notify the Federal Trade Commission of any failure to post the automotive fuel rating.


(2) The Federal Trade Commission may enter into interagency agreements with the Environmental Protection Agency and such other agencies of the United States as the Commission determines appropriate for the purpose of assuring enforcement of the provisions of this subchapter in a manner which is consistent with—(A) minimizing the cost of field inspection and related compliance activities; and

(4) The Federal Trade Commission may, by rule, prescribe and make effective a method of determining the automotive fuel rating of automotive fuel which consists of a blend of two or more quantities of automotive fuel of different automotive fuel ratings if the Federal Trade Commission finds that the method prescribed more accurately reflects the automotive fuel rating of such blend than the weighted-average method set forth in section 2822(f)(1) of this title. Effective on and after the effective date of such rule, any person shall be considered to satisfy the requirements of section 2822(f)(1) of this title only if such person utilizes the method prescribed in such rule (in lieu of the method set forth in section 2822(f)(1) of this title).
