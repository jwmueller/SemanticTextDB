(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 828; Sept. 1, 1954, ch. 1214, § 12(a), formerly § 10(a), 68 Stat. 1145; renumbered Pub. L. 87–299, § 1, Sept. 26, 1961, 75 Stat. 648; Pub. L. 108–21, title VI, § 610(a), Apr. 30, 2003, 117 Stat. 692.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 746(g) of title 8, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Aliens and Nationality, and on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 582 (R.S. § 1044; Apr. 13, 1876, ch. 56, 19 Stat. 32; Nov. 17, 1921, ch. 124, § 1, 42 Stat. 220; Dec. 27, 1927, ch. 6, 45 Stat. 51; Oct. 14, 1940, ch. 876, title I, subchap. III, § 346(g), 54 Stat. 1167).
Section 582 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 746(g) of title 8, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Aliens and Nationality, were consolidated. “Except as otherwise expressly provided by law” was inserted to avoid enumeration of exceptive provisions.
The proviso contained in the act of 1927 “That nothing herein contained shall apply to any offense for which an indictment has been heretofore found or an information instituted, or to any proceedings under any such indictment or information,” was omitted as no longer necessary.
In the consolidation of these sections the 5-year period of limitation for violations of the Nationality Code, provided for in said section 746(g) of title 8, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Aliens and Nationality, is reduced to 3 years. There seemed no sound basis for considering 3 years adequate in the case of heinous felonies and gross frauds against the United States but inadequate for misuse of a passport or false statement to a naturalization examiner.

Amendments2003—Pub. L. 108–21 designated existing provisions as subsec. (a), inserted heading, and added subsec. (b).
1954—Act Sept. 1, 1954, changed the limitation period from three years to five years.

Effective Date of 1954 AmendmentAct Sept. 1, 1954, ch. 1214, § 12(b), formerly section 10(b), 68 Stat. 1145, as renumbered by Pub. L. 87–299, § 1, Sept. 26, 1961, 75 Stat. 648, provided that: “The amendment made by subsection (a) [amending this section] shall be effective with respect to offenses (1) committed on or after September 1, 1954, or (2) committed prior to such date, if on such date prosecution therefor is not barred by provisions of law in effect prior to such date.”
