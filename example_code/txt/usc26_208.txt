If the taxpayer makes an election under this section and if assessment of any deficiency for any taxable year resulting from such election is prevented on the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 4, 1976], or at any time within one year after such date, by the operation of any law or rule of law, such assessment (to the extent attributable to such election) may, nevertheless, be made if made within one year after such date.”
