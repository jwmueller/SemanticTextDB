References in TextThis chapter, referred to in text, was in the original “this subtitle”, meaning subtitle E (§§ 5401 to 5413, 5421 to 5423) of title V of Pub. L. 100–418 which, in addition to enacting this chapter, enacted section 4603a of this title and section 194b of Title 2, The Congress. For complete classification of subtitle E to the Code, see Tables.
Section 4906 of this title, referred to in par. (4), was in the original “section 3816”, meaning section 3816 of Pub. L. 100–418, and was translated as if it read section 5406 of Pub. L. 100–418, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because section 3816 was the provision which established the Data Bank in a predecessor version of H.R. 4848 (which became Pub. L. 100–418), Pub. L. 100–418 does not contain a section 3816, and section 5406 of Pub. L. 100–418 is the provision establishing the Data Bank.
