Such rules, regulations, or orders may specify changes with respect to such matters as—(A) terms or conditions in contracts of sale to be executed on or subject to the rules of such registered entity;

The term “emergency” as used herein shall mean, in addition to threatened or actual market manipulations and corners, any act of the United States or a foreign government affecting a commodity or any other major market disturbance which prevents the market from accurately reflecting the forces of supply and demand for such commodity. Any action taken by the Commission under this paragraph shall be subject to review only in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the party seeking review resides or has its principal place of business, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Such review shall be based upon an examination of all the information before the Commission at the time the determination was made. The court reviewing the Commission’s action shall not enter a stay or order of mandamus unless it has determined, after notice and hearing before a panel of the court, that the agency action complained of was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the meaning or interpretation given by a registered entity to the terms “market emergency”, “emergency”, or equivalent language in its own bylaws, rules, regulations, or resolutions;

(11)(A) by written notice served on the person and pursuant to such rules, regulations, and orders as the Commission may adopt, to suspend or modify the registration of any person registered under this chapter who is charged (in any information, indictment, or complaint authorized by a United States attorney or an appropriate official of any State) with the commission of or participation in a crime involving a violation of this chapter, or a violation of any other provision of Federal or State law that would reflect on the honesty or the fitness of the person to act as a fiduciary (including an offense specified in subparagraph (D) or (E) of paragraph (2)) that is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, if the Commission determines that continued registration of the person may pose a threat to the public interest or may threaten to impair public confidence in any market regulated by the Commission.

(B) Prior to the suspension or modification of the registration of a person under this paragraph, the person shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing at which the Commission shall have the burden of showing that the continued registration of the person does, or is likely to, pose a threat to the public interest or threaten to impair public confidence in any market regulated by the Commission.

(C) Any notice of suspension or modification issued under this paragraph shall remain in effect until such information, indictment, or complaint is disposed of or until terminated by the Commission.

(D) On disposition of such information, indictment, or complaint, the Commission may issue and serve on such person an order pursuant to paragraph (2) or (4) to suspend, restrict, or revoke the registration of such person.

(E) A finding of not guilty or other disposition of the charge shall not preclude the Commission from thereafter instituting any other proceedings under this chapter.

(F) A person aggrieved by an order issued under this paragraph may obtain review of such order in the same manner and on the same terms and conditions as are provided in section 8(b) of this title.
