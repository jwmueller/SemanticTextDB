References in TextSections 321, 322, 324, and 325a of title 40, referred to in subsec. (a), mean sections 321, 322, 324, and 325a of former title 40 which were repealed by Pub. L. 87–581, title II, § 203, Aug. 13, 1962, 76 Stat. 360. See sections 3702, 3703, and 3708 of Title 40, Public Buildings, Property, and Works.

Codification
In the second sentence of subsec. (a), the words “and the compensation of the persons so appointed may be fixed without regard to the provisions of the Classification Act of 1923, as amended” were omitted as obsolete. Sections 1202 and 1204 of the Classification Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 972, 973, repealed the 1923 Act and all laws or parts of laws inconsistent with the 1949 Act. While section 1106(a) of the 1949 Act provided that references in other laws to the 1923 Act should be held and considered to mean the 1949 Act, it did not have the effect of continuing the exceptions contained in this subsection because of section 1106(b) which provided that the application of the 1949 Act of any position, officer, or employee shall not be affected by section 1106(a). The Classification Act of 1949 was repealed by Act Sept. 6, 1966, Pub. L. 89–554, § 8(a), 80 Stat. 632 (of which section 1 revised and enacted Title 5, U.S.C., into law). Section 5102 of Title 5 contains the applicability provisions of the 1949 Act, and section 5103 of Title 5 authorizes the Office of Personnel Management to determine the applicability to specific positions and employees.

Amendments1942—Subsec. (a). Act Oct. 20, 1942, §§ 5, 7, substituted “other countries” for “countries in the Western Hemisphere” and inserted sentence relating to inapplicability of certain sections of title 40.
Subsecs. (e), (f). Act Oct. 20, 1942, § 6, added subsecs. (e) and (f).
