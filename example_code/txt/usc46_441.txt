30702(b)46 App.:195.Feb. 13, 1893, ch. 105, § 7, 27 Stat. 446.


Subsection (a) is added based on language appearing in various source provisions restated in this chapter. The word “carriage” is substituted for “transporting”, and the word “goods” is substituted for “merchandise or property”, to use the same terminology as in the Carriage of Goods By Sea Act (Apr. 16, 1936, ch. 229, 49 Stat. 1207). The words “to or from any port in the United States” are substituted for “from or between ports of the United States and foreign ports” in 46 App. U.S.C. 190 and 193, “from or between ports of the United States of America and foreign ports” in 46 App. U.S.C. 191, and “to or from any port in the United States of America” in 46 App. U.S.C. 192, for clarity and consistency. See Knott v. Botany Mills, 179 U.S. 69 (1900).
