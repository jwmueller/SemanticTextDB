(6) report to the Secretary on compliance with this subsection.


(b) Failure To Complete Course of Instruction.—(1) Active duty.—If the Secretary of Transportation determines that an individual who has attended the Academy for at least 2 years has failed to fulfill the part of the agreement described in subsection (a)(1), the individual may be ordered by the Secretary of Defense to serve on active duty in one of the armed forces of the United States for a period of not more than 2 years. In cases of hardship as determined by the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Transportation may waive this paragraph in whole or in part.

(2) Recovery of cost.—If the Secretary of Defense is unable or unwilling to order an individual to serve on active duty under paragraph (1), or if the Secretary of Transportation determines that reimbursement of the cost of education provided would better serve the interests of the United States, the Secretary of Transportation may recover from the individual the cost of education provided by the Government.

The Secretary may reduce the amount to be recovered to reflect partial performance of service obligations and other factors the Secretary determines merit a reduction.


(d) Actions To Recover Cost.—To aid in the recovery of the cost of education provided by the Government under a commitment agreement under this section, the Secretary of Transportation may—(1) request the Attorney General to bring a civil action against the individual; and
