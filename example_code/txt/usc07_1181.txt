Emergency Food Assistance to IndiaPub. L. 90–7, Apr. 1, 1967, 81 Stat. 7, provided: 
“That the Congress approves the participation of the United States in cooperation with other countries and with multilateral organizations, including the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and others, in urgent international efforts designed to—
“(a) develop a comprehensive self-help approach to the war on hunger based on a fair sharing of the burden among the nations of the world;

“(b) encourage and assist the Government of India in achieving food self-sufficiency; and

“(c) help meet India’s critical food and nutritional needs by making available agricultural commodities or other resources needed for food procurement or production.“Because uncertainty in connection with Public Law 480 transactions tends to depress market prices, it is the sense of Congress that, in carrying out this Aid to India program, the Administration should, subject to the requirement of section 401 of Public Law 480 [section 1731 of this title] with respect to the availability of the commodity at the time of exportation, make announcements of intention, purchases and shipments of commodities on schedules and under circumstances which will protect and strengthen farm market prices to the maximum extent possible.
“The Congress endorses the President’s policy of equal participation on the part of the United States with all other nations, under terms and conditions set forth in Public Law 480, as amended [this chapter], in assisting the Government of India to meet these needs.
“Further, the Congress recommends, on the basis of estimates now available, that the United States provide an additional amount of food grain not to exceed three million tons at an estimated cost of $190,000,000 as the United States share toward meeting the India food deficit, provided it is appropriately matched, and specifically extends its support to the allocation of approximately $190,000,000 of funds available to the Commodity Credit Corporation in calendar year 1967 which will be required to accomplish this purpose.
“The Congress further recommends that the President provide an additional $25,000,000 of emergency food relief for distribution by CARE and other American voluntary agencies.”
