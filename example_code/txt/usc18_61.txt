Words “upon conviction” were deleted as surplusage since punishment can be imposed only after a conviction.
A fine of “$5,000” was substituted for “$10,000” and “one year” for “five years”, to reduce the offense to the grade of a misdemeanor and the punishment to an amount and term proportionate to the gravity of the offense.
Minor changes were made in phraseology.
