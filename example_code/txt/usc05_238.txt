DerivationU.S. CodeRevised Statutes andStatutes at Large


 5 U.S.C. 631 (less last 16 words).R.S. § 1753 (less last 16 words).


The words “civil service in the executive branch” are substituted for “civil service of the United States” to confirm the grant of authority in view of the definition of “civil service” in section 2101. The word “will” is substituted for “may”. The words “for the employment sought” are substituted for “for the branch of service into which he seeks to enter” as the latter are archaic since there are no “branches” within the executive branch. The word “applicant” is substituted for “candidate”.
Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
