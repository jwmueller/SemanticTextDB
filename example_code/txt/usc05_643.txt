Historical and Revision Notes


DerivationU.S. CodeRevised Statutes andStatutes at Large


(a)–(c)5 U.S.C. 103a.July 8, 1940, ch. 551, § 1, 54 Stat. 743.July 15, 1954, ch. 507, § 7(b), 68 Stat. 479.
(d)5 U.S.C. 103b.July 8, 1940, ch. 551, § 2, 54 Stat. 744.


Subsection (a) is based on the words “department, independent establishment, agency, or federally owned or controlled corporation, hereinafter called department” in former section 103a. The terms “Executive agency” and “military department” include a department, independent establishment, agency, or federally owned or controlled corporation in the executive branch because of the definitions in sections 105 and 102.
The words “a military department” are included to preserve the application of the source law. Before enactment of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 578), the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force were Executive departments. The National Security Act Amendments of 1949 established the Department of Defense as an Executive Department including the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force, as military departments, not as Executive departments. However, the source law for this section, which was in effect in 1949, remained applicable to the Secretaries of the military departments by virtue of section 12(g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 591), which is set out in the reviser’s note for section 301.
Subsection (b) is restated for clarity and conciseness and to eliminate redundancy. In paragraphs (1) and (2), the words “outside the United States” are coextensive with and substituted for “in a Territory or possession of the United States or in a foreign country”.
Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
