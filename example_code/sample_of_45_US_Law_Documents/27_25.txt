Codification

Subsections (a) to (d) provided for the creation of a Federal Alcohol Administration as a division of the Treasury Department. By act June 26, 1936, ch. 830, title V, 49 Stat. 1964, however, those subsections were repealed and a new Administration created as an independent agency. The repealing act was to be effective when the new administrators authorized thereby were appointed. While the officers so authorized were never appointed and the repeal therefore never became effective, subsections (a) to (d) have been omitted in view of Reorg. Plan No. III of 1940, set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees, which abolished the Administration and transferred its functions to the Secretary of the Treasury to be administered through the Bureau of Internal Revenue [now Internal Revenue Service]. See, also, Transfer of Functions note set out under section 201 of this title.

Amendments
1946—Subsec. (i). Act Aug. 7, 1946, struck out subsec. (i) which related to reports to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to the administration of the functions charged to the Secretary under this chapter.
