The Secretary of the Treasury shall, by order, grant or deny such application on the basis of the proof submitted to him and his finding thereon. The District Courts of the United States, and the United States court for any Territory shall have jurisdiction of suits to enjoin, annul, or suspend in whole or in part any final action by the Secretary upon any application under this subsection.

Codification
As originally enacted subsec. (a) of this section contained a reference to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. Act June 25, 1936, substituted “the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia” for “the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia”, and act June 25, 1948, as amended by act May 24, 1949, substituted “United States District Court for the District of Columbia” for “district court of the United States for the District of Columbia”. However, the words “United States District Court for the District of Columbia” have been deleted entirely as superfluous in view of section 132(a) of Title 28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure, which states that “There shall be in each judicial district a district court which shall be a court of record known as the United States District Court for the district”, and section 88 of Title 28 which states that “the District of Columbia constitutes one judicial district”.

Amendments1988—Subsecs. (a), (b)(1), (3), (4). Pub. L. 100–690, § 8001(b)(2), substituted “the date of the enactment of this title” for “the date of the enactment of this Act”, which had been translated editorially as “August 29, 1935”, thereby requiring no change in text.


Transfer of Functions
“Secretary of the Treasury” and “Secretary” were substituted for “Administrator”, meaning the Administrator of the Federal Alcohol Administration, pursuant to Reorg. Plan No. III of 1940, see note set out under section 201 of this title.
